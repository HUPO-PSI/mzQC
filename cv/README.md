# The Quality Control Controlled Vocabulary (QC CV)

The PSI-QC controlled vocabulary (CV) is intended to provide terms for the 
definition of quality metrics and related supporting values. The CV contains 
entries for metrics that can be recorded in the mzQC files. While the mzQC 
format allows storing any metric information, the CV makes it possible to 
interpret the actual values.

## QC CV Moved Home
The PSI-QC controlled vocabulary moved home and is now part of (https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/psi-ms-CV/)!
This folder is for legacy and QC CV specific code only.

## How It Works
Please see [our website](https://hupo-psi.github.io/mzQC/) for more information on how the PSI-QC controlled vocabulary (CV) works with mzQC.

## CV Term Creation for QC Metric Definition
We use a dedicated issue template to request new QC terms for the PSI-MS-CV. 
If you want to request a new term, please do so [there (PSI-MS-CV)](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/psi-ms-CV/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=new_qc_term.yml).
