name: chromatographic peak asymmetry
def: Asymmetry is a factor describing the shape (skew) of a chromatographic peak, indicating the divergence from the theoretically symmetrical Gaussian shape. It is defined as the distance from the center line of the peak to the back slope divided by the distance from the center line of the peak to the front slope, with all measurements made at 10% of the maximum peak height. A value of >1 indicates a tailing peak and <1 a fronting peak.

name: chromatographic peak tailing
def: The tailing factor describes the extent to which a chromatographic peak is tailing off. It is defined as the distance from the front slope of the peak to the back slope divided by twice the distance from the center line of the peak to the front slope, with all measurements made at 5% of the maximum peak height.
