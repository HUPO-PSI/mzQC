For each base peak, both the m/z and intensity of every instance in which an ion (not necessarily a base peak) within the m/z tolerance of the base peak is picked up is added to an array for m/z and an array for intensity and the mean of those arrays are determined. The mean m/z is divided by the m/z at which the base peak was reported as a base peak. This value is squared and multiplied by the intensity mean. The intensity of the base peak when it was reported as a base peak is then divided by this result." [PSI:QC]
comment: The larger the value, the less precise the m/z value of the peak. The value is weighted so as to not penalize low intensity peaks.
