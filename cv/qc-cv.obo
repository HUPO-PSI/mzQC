remark: metric name synonyms can be used to allow alternative names which e.g. have been used in previous publication or older software to allow a measure of downwards compatibility
remark: synonyms can be 'RELATED' (the defined metric is similar, but not the same as what is connected with the synonym name), 'NARROW' (the metric's values can be identically interpreted as in the meaning of the synonym metric, however definition and calculation may somewhat differ), 'EXACT' (the defined metric is basically a result of renaming)
