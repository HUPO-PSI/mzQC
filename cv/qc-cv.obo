name: Fraction of peptide IDs around max MS1
def: "Fraction of peptides identified at least X minutes earlier or later than the most intense MS1 signal of the identification. The first column contains the time in seconds, divided into minute wise intervals X per row, the other comlumn the fraction of identified. Negative time values indicate minutes before and positive after maximum MS1." [PSI:QC]
comment: Estimates very early/late peak broadening.

name: peptide elution order - trailing
def: "N(a, b) are the peptides common in the run and a reference run. N(a,b)_i to N(a,b)_j are the first to last eluting common peptides in the run ordered by retention time. This metric is the maximum of ('elution rank' of peptide N(a,b)_t in run) - ('elution_rank' of peptide N(a,b)_t in reference) for the first tenth of common peptides ordered by retention time. The metric is finally normalised with dividing by the number of (identified) peptides in the run." [PSI:QC]
comment: The elution rank difference gives you a measure of how many peptides are eluting early.
