#summary This page explains the control of quality metrics by CV.

= Introduction =

The control of metrics via a controlled vocabulary is quite forward. A controlled vocabulary entry can describe both experimental as well as programmatic environmental variables. It is comprised of a name, a identifier, a definition and associated relations. The latter makes the CV  hierarchical structurable.

{{{
[Term]
 id: QC:0000039
 name: delta ppm
 def: "The deviation of the precursor ion mass and the theoretical mass of the matched identification." [PXS:QC]
 relationship: has_units UO:0000169 ! parts per million

}}}
The qualitative description of mass deviation is called _delta ppm_ and runs under the identifier _QC:0000039_. It is subordinate to the comprising term of _MS identification result details_ and has the unit _parts per million_.

A _quality parameter_ has cv elements built in that will describe his type and alike. The cv structure is called cv param type and all it's attributes will be directly built in the _quality parameter_.
