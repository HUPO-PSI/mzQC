#summary This page explains the control of quality metrics by CV.

= Introduction =

The control of metrics via a controlled vocabulary is quite forward. A controlled vocabulary entry can describe both experimental as well as programmatic environmental variables. It is comprised of a name, a identifier, a definition and associated relations. The latter makes the CV  hierarchical structurable. 

= Details =

{{{
[Term]
 id: QC:0000039
 name: delta ppm
 def: "The deviation of the precursor ion mass and the theoretical mass of the matched identification." [PXS:QC]
 relationship: has_units UO:0000169 ! parts per million
 is_a: QC:0000025 ! MS identification result details
}}}
The qualitative description of mass deviation is called _delta ppm_ and runs under the identifier _QC:0000039_. It is subordinate to the comprising term of _MS identification result details_ and has the unit _parts per million_.

A _quality parameter_ has a cv element built in that will describe his type and alike.
