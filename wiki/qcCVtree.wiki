#A CV tree to reflect the PrimeXS basic QC metrics

* A cv does not neccessarily have to have a value (in which case there is a NA). 
* A cv may have a linked attachment type (in which case the cv is to be reused in the attachment element).
* A cv may have a linked attachment type of both binary and table order (which are easily distinguished while parsing by the occurrence of the binary child element or the table row element of which a attachment element can only have either one).
* A new kind of table or plot can be attached to any QC element of one of the cv below by qualityParameterRef with the use of the custom cv.
