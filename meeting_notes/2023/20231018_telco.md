## Data analysis for mzQC software libraries manuscript

- There was a discussion on the different spectrum ID rate between Mathias' and Chris' reanalysis of the data (40 vs 60%). Conclusion: not that important for our analysis.
- Mathias has expanded the manuscript with Methods information about how the QC metrics are generated.
    - We should add high-level code snippets as an illustration of the different tools.
    - **@Everyone**: Go through the manuscript and provide feedback by the next call.
- Mathias has drafted an initial version of a figure to illustrate our workflow. You can use this as a [starting point](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1_uJcJSjhk1Hhyt9driksIci-qQmY2GuP-P-ZzsoXSHU/edit?pli=1) and propose your alternatives.
- **@Everyone**: Check the conclusion and see if all relevant aspects are mentioned.
