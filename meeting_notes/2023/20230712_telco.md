## CV terms for msQuality software

[Thomas Naake has proposed several CV terms for his msQuality software.](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/psi-ms-CV/pull/206)

- Wout & Chris have reviewed the PR. We provided some comments to represent things more consistently.
- Some terms are similar to existing metrics calculated by other tools, but these are not explicitly linked to each other.
    - In general, we allow each tool to have their own set of metrics, calculated in each own's specific fashion.
    - On the other hand, we want to avoid duplication of terms.
    - As there are no hard restrictions mandated by the PSI-MS CV, we request requesters to check whether their terms aren't available yet.

## mzQC validator

Mathias is making progress on fixing the mzQC validator and deploying it to Nils' web hosting. He will meet with Nils to set this up.

## mzQC software tools manuscript

Software libraries use case:

- We will replace spectrum identification with ANN-SoLo by sequence database searching using Comet.
    - The FASTA file for the AutoQC runs should be BSA, with other contaminants added.
- We will include the [iPRG2015 dataset](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jproteome.6b00881) as well.
    - The FASTA file is available from MassIVE, with which we will include common contaminants.
