## Working Group Chair

We had one candidate for the new working group chair: Wout Bittremieux.

Wout has unanimously been elected as the new working group chair.

We will check with Dave when he wants to move into a chair emeritus role and communicate the change in roles to the PSI Steering Committee.

## mzQC software libraries manuscript

Mathias has worked on updating the use case example by generating longitudinal metrics from the AutoQC dataset.

- Some issues with automatically providing containers for all software libraries. People can use the respective programming language toolchains as well (PyPI, CRAN, Maven), so it's not crucial that we have containers as well. Conclusion: move forward without general-purpose containers at this point, focus on getting the use case results.
- Mathias will calculate QC metrics from all peak files and share the corresponding mzQC files (i.e. Google Drive) for everyone to have a look at to figure out which results to show in the manuscript.
- Goal: Have the preprint out before ASMS (June 4â€“8).

## Miscellaneous

- Due to ASMS, the next teleconference will move up one week to May 31, 2023. Our goal is to finalize the software libraries manuscript then.
- Wout's access to Zoom premium through UCSD has expired. He will set up a recurring Microsoft Teams meeting instead.
