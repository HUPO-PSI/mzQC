## mzQC specification

We addressed a few open GitHub issues:

- [#123](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/213): We fixed requirements for time zone formatting.
- [#199](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/199): We modified `URI` to be optional for `analysisSoftware` and clarified in the specification document which information can be provided as `version`.
- [#51](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/51): Mathias will update the overview of semantic validation rules in the specification document.

**TODO everyone:** Check the [issues on GitHub](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues) prior to the next teleconference to prioritize ones that we can easily address.

## Manuscripts

[mzQC software tools manuscript](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d-Il6MYJ5zQ-8UpabHe84L3Vau7bzuu5UZlTieGT2Js/edit):

- Our current use cases deal with proteomics data only. This is not a problem because the manuscript will focus on the technical aspects.
- Structure of the manuscript:
    - Present the different mzQC softwares per programming language: GitHub repository, container, examples in notebook form.
    - Demonstrate interoperability: workflow that combines three use cases and different APIs.
- Do we want a common test case suite? No, we don't want to mandate small implementation details beyond the official specification.
