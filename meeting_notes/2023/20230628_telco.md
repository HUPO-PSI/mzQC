## QC metrics for top-down proteomics

- QC metrics (number of spectra, charge state, ...) can be calculated before and after specific data processing steps (deconvolution). Should we semi-duplicate CV terms for each situation?
    - No, this would result in a proliferation of extremely similar CV terms.
    - Instead, the same CV term can be used in different mzQC files, with different files applicable to different processing steps. This inherently fits the current mzQC workflow and avoids an explosion of CV terms.

## mzQC software libraries manuscript

Mathias will create a release candidate of the use case workflow. Unfortunately this still largely involves a manual effort. Mathias will share mzQC files with updated QC metrics afterwards.
