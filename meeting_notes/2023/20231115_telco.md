## mzQC software libraries manuscript

Mathias described using a [new dataset](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1756464623002451) and [corresponding analysis](https://github.com/MS-Quality-Hub/mzqclib-manuscript/blob/docu_and_updates/workflow/mzqc_heatmap_draft.ipynb) to illustrate the mzQC software libraries.
- The dataset includes proteomics and metabolomics data, which could be useful for additional analyses. It's a more modern dataset (Q-Exactive) than the previous one.
- Mathias presented his detailed analysis (see notebook). We shouldn't overinterpret the QC results, which is also not relevant for the current manuscript.
- We can use this dataset as a simple example, avoiding overemphasis on minor QC issues. The detailed QC analysis can be included as supplementary material, while focusing on the software functionality and interoperability in the manuscript.

Alternative datasets: RawBeans included explicitly introduced instrument malfunctioning. This could be relevant for our other manuscript.

## mzQC specification document

- The comments from the public review phase were addressed a while ago, but resubmission was placed on hold to coordinate this with the timing of the manuscript(s).
- Should we include a guide to visualization in the specification document ([#215](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/215))? We will provide it as online guidelines and best practices, rather than part of the technical specification.
- Semantic validation ([#51](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/51)): we discussed which semantic checks should be explicitly listed in the specification document.
- We looked at existing GitHub issues and PRs to ensure that the specification document reflects the latest developments and decisions made.
