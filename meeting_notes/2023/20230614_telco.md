## Working group charter

We updated the working group charter with some minor text changes. Wout will send it to Sandra for inclusion on the new PSI website.

## CV terms for top-down proteomics

Dave highlighted QC approaches and challenges for top-down proteomics:

- There are four major identification pipelines, which each use different deconvolution software with different output formats each.
- Common instruments are Thermo Obitraps and Bruker Q-TOFs, but bioinformatics pipelines might not provide universal support.
- There is no standard way to perform data acquisition, everyone has their own flavor.
- QC-related information isn't always retained in mzML files. E.g. ProteoWizard reports the start timestamp (when was the original raw data collected) but not the precursor charges, whereas software that reports the precursor charges omits the start timestamp.
- Deconvolution is essential when analyzing topdown data. In practice, QC metrics will be generated from two files: (i) the raw data (mzML files), and (ii) the deconvolved spectra (i.e. MGF files). Consequently, scans in both files need to be linked to each other.

Dave discussed several relevant QC metrics based on a proposed data structure for this TDAuditor software:

```
class ScanMetrics {
    public int    ScanNumber=0;
    public float  ScanStartTime=0;
    public string mzMLDissociation="";
    public int    mzMLPrecursorZ=0;
    public int    msAlignPrecursorZ=0;
    public int    mzMLPeakCount=0;
    public int    msAlignPeakCount=0;
    public float  DirecTagScore=0;
    public ScanMetrics Next = null;
}

class LCMSMSExperiment {
    // Fields read directly from file
    public string SourceFile="";
    public string Instrument="";
    public string SerialNumber="";
    public string StartTimeStamp="";
    public float  MaxScanStartTime=0;
    // Computed fields
    public int    mzMLMS1Count=0;
    public int    mzMLMSnCount=0;
    public int    msAlignMSnCount=0;
    // The following MSn counts reflect mzML information
    public int    HCDCount=0;
    public int    CIDCount=0;
    public int    ETDCount=0;
    public int    ECDCount=0;
    public int    IRMPDCount=0;
    // Charge state histograms
    public static int MaxZ=100;
    public int[]  mzMLPrecursorZ    = new int[MaxZ];
    public int[]  msAlignPrecursorZ = new int[MaxZ];
    // Per-scan metrics
    public ScanMetrics      ScansTable = new ScanMetrics();
    public LCMSMSExperiment Next = null;
}
```

As well as potential terms sourced from the PSI-MS CV:
```
sourceFile name
CommonInstrumentParams	# for instr model and serial from first CIP
MS:1002732  # Orbitrap Fusion Lumos
MS:1001911  # Q Exactive
MS:1000557  # LTQ FT Ultra
MS:1001910  # LTQ Orbitrap Elite
MS:1000463  # All of these are of type "instrument"
MS:1000529  # instrument serial number
startTimeStamp inside run tag # Date and time of experiment start
MS:1000016  # highest retention time / gradient length / acquisition time
MS:1000579  # count of MS1 spectra
MS:1000580  # count of MSn spectra
# The following tags fall under "activation"
MS:1000422  # subdivided by fragmentation type (HCD)
MS:1000133  # subdivided by fragmentation type (CID)
MS:1000598  # subdivided by fragmentation type (ETD)
MS:1000262  # subdivided by fragmentation type (IRMPD)
# Do we need to search for mixes of ECT, or mixes of ETD and HCD?
MS:1000041  # histogram precursor Z before deconvolution
msAlign     # histogram precursor Z after deconvolution
msAlign     # count of MSn spectra after deconvolution
#per scan
MS:1000016 # retention time
MS:1000041 # precursor charge state before deconvolution
msAlign    # precursor charge state after deconvolution
defaultArrayLength inside spectrum tag # peak count before deconvolution
msAlign    # peak count after deconvolution
lowest DirecTag probability
# Can we quantify precursor mass diversity?

```

These would constitute a first set of lightweight QC metrics for top-down proteomics, focused on Thermo instruments (e.g. scan number is different for Bruker instruments, in which case a native ID should be used).

New CV terms to be proposed:

- Information related to the deconvolution.
- Score for _de novo_ inference using DirecTag.
- Other terms based on the data structure above.

We discussed whether we want to include additional characterization to group CV terms related to top-down proteomics. Currently the CV enforces minimal categorization, but in our QC sub-namespace we have done some of this. Would it be relevant to try to group semantically related terms, e.g. CV terms related to QC for top-down proteomics?

- Mathias will reflect on how to represent collections of terms in the CV.
- We should look at the data structure above and propose new CV terms for missing QC metrics.

## mzQC software tools manuscript

We looked at the full set of AutoQC metrics that Mathias has generated. Mathias briefly highlighted the various metrics that are currently calculated. In addition, Mathias will update the workflow to calculate further metrics that could be relevant in a longitudinal context (distribution of missed cleavages, mass accuracy, injection time).
