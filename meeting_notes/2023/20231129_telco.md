## CV term for Contaminant IDs

There was still an [open issue](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/psi-ms-CV/issues/209) for a CV term reporting the number of spectra identified as contaminants. We had a discussion on its relevancy and whether to report the absolute count or relative percentage. Ultimately, as this term is not in active use yet, we decide to skip officially defining it for now. When relevant, we will propose a new CV term.

## Specification document

We had a detailed look at the [specification document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14mC7sDjPpeg7uFVZSaPv799CgSHqKMmzKuv-rLepuhc/edit), with special emphasis on the semantic validation. We clarified a few of the semantic validation checks during the definition of the mzQC elements already and made sure that this information is fully consistent.

**TODO @Wout** will submit the specification document to the final stage of the document process.
