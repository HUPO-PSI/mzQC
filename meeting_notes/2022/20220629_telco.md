## Various updates

- Sylvie has confirmed that the specification document is now going through the document process.
- Development of rmzQC is progressing (slowly).
- Nils gave a nice shout-out on Twitter to David Broadhurst to support mzQC in his new metabolomics QC tool.
- Nils has updated us on a reboot of the ELIXIR metabolomics initiative, with QC as part of it. We should try to get engaged with ELIXIR to be involved in the QC efforts.

## mzQC Website

- The website has been moved to the `main` branch from the separate `gh-pages` branch. Deployment instructions are under `doc/gh-page`.
- **@Mathias** will further move the website directly in a `doc` folder for easier (automatic) deployment.
- The specification document has been included as HTML export. For simplicity and conservation of the document layout, upon updates we will use a PDF embed instead.
- We will restructure the website top menu and content as discussed during the call.
