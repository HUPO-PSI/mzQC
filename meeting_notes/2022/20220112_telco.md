## Miscellaneous

David Jimenez-Morales joined the call and described his [artMS](https://biodavidjm.github.io/artMS/index.html) package for quality control of MaxQuant data.

## Document process

The specification document is ready for resubmission to the PSI document process. Relevant sections have been updated to reflect our merging into the PSI-MS-CV rather than using our own QC CV.

Mathias will send the specification document to Sylvie when we have the first open PR for CV merging.

## PSI-MS-CV integration

- Units vs value concepts: SI units should be specified using `has_units`, other concepts to help interpretation of metrics (e.g. fraction, log ratio, ...) should be specified using `has_value_concept`.
- Table metric columns: No need to explicitly redefine metrics as table column metrics, instead existing metrics can be used directly as columns. This needs to be reflected in the specification document.
- Comments: Comments are an official OBO tag and can be retained. We will only use comments if truly necessary and only to discuss information needed to interpret the metrics (e.g. warn against division by zero, extreme value information, ...).
- Dave and Mathias will work together to remove ambiguities in the definition of QuaMeter terms.

Our next meeting will be on January 26.
