- Dave will discuss QC for top-down proteomics (1h).

## Software implementations

- rmzqc: Chris & David have the majority of the functionality ready. rmzqc will support syntactic validation, but not semantic validation.

Semantic validation:

- We need to [collect rules for semantic validation](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/51) to check in the pymzqc reference implementation.
- Semantic validation (with pymzqc backend) is available through the [online validator](https://hupo-psi.github.io/mzQC/validator.html).
