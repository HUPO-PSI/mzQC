## Miscellaneous

The mailing list seems to be experiencing some issues, with emails not being delivered. We have used personal emails this time, and will look into setting up an alternative mailing list if problems persist.

We haven't received the reviewer comments yet.

## Manuscripts

mzQC software manuscript

- The initial target was the JPR software special issue. We got an extension on the deadline, but we likely won't be able to finish the manuscript in time. It is better to produce a high-quality manuscript than to rush it out.

Overall goals of the manuscript:

- We have to show value for QC software developers in using mzQC.
    - They help developers to write syntactically valid mzQC documents.
    - They can efficiently and robustly process mzQC files for very large experiments.
        - We could create large mzQC files by computing metrics for individual scans, rather than for runs. E.g. a table with the number of peaks per MS/MS spectrum.
        - Third-party examples: [Xrea](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/pr0603248), [ScanRanker](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/pr200118r).
    - What are the advantages of using the mzQC libraries compared to any generic JSON parser.

Use cases:

- pymzqc: The PRIDE contaminants spectral library can't be used because it is not compatible with SpectraST. Maybe this [recent paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jproteome.2c00145) has an alternative spectral library? **TODO @Wout** will look into this. ALternative we can just use sequence database searching against cRAP.
- jmzqc: Nils has created an [mzQC file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nilshoffmann/jmzqc-usecase/main/MTBLS1375.mzQC) with quality metrics for SRM lipidomics data (number of chromatograms, m/z acquisition range, RT acquisition range, XIC area for each transition). The USP might also have [chromatography quality standard](https://www.usp.org/harmonization-standards/pdg/excipients/chromatography).
