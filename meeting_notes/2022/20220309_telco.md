## PSI Spring Meeting 2022

The [PSI Spring Meeting 2022](https://psidev.info/hupo-psi-meeting-2022) will take place in Hinxton, UK on May 11â€“13, 2022.

Who will be attending?

- In-person: Mathias, David, Julian, Nils
- Virtually: Wout

Meeting planning:

- [Preliminary program](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FGL2i4gENoMMhWPqky9nMoLFwfw0bL7-KBw-SrONSTw/edit?usp=sharing)
- We probably don't need a separate QC track for 2 full days. Current proposal: one day for QC, join the MS/PI track otherwise.
- Topics to discuss:
    1. Software implementation hackathon
    2. Metrics definition and brainstorm
    3. Manuscript drafting session
    4. MIAPE: revisit or shelve? (tentative)
- Mathias will draft a preliminary program with these topics.

## mzQC software implementations

All mzQC software implementations will be grouped under the [MS-Quality-hub](https://github.com/MS-Quality-hub/) GitHub organization.

Consistent package naming:
- [pymzqc](https://github.com/MS-Quality-hub/pymzqc): Python reference implementation (Mathias)
- [rmzqc](https://github.com/MS-Quality-hub/rmzqc): R (Chris, David)
- [jmqzqc](https://github.com/MS-Quality-hub/jmzqc): Java (Nils)

David and Chris have been coordinating to collaborate on the rmzqc development and are making nice progress.

We will collect a common test cases in the [test suite](https://github.com/MS-Quality-hub/common-test-suite) repository.

- Large files on GitHub are suboptimal (i.e. input mzML files). Instead we will start test cases from public data on ProteomeXchange.

## PSI-MS CV merging

- The QC term request issue template is live on PSI-MS-CV repository.
- There has been an active discussion on recent CV term merging issues. Rather than wait for a consensus to arise for all CV terms, we will extract the ["half-TIC" term](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/psi-ms-CV/issues/106) needed for specification document resubmission and proceed with merging this individually.
