## Specification document

We received [positive reviewer comments](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IfXpzuiVPRjFVaRYfRgVLmH6Kkytu9Df), which could easily be addressed by minor modifications to the [specification document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/132F3MBgDJgtFlXxDZhpJ1oHGbKL8pT6dk9fvL55L5_M/edit?usp=sharing). Mathias and Chris have gone through all comments and made changes to the specification document accordingly. We briefly discussed and resolved any outstanding issues.

## PSI-MS CV integration

- Discussion of [PR 155](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/psi-ms-CV/pull/155) to update the current batch of CV terms. These are now ready for consideration by the PSI-MS group.
- Mathias created [draft PR 165](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/psi-ms-CV/pull/165) with the next batch of CV terms based on initial discussions on Slack.

## Manuscripts

- Status update and task distribution of the use cases in the [mzQC specification manuscript](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fYPqDBqFamcjXlzX0RMStPOKQD4aHlQd9JHJAfqcjqs/edit).
- Mathias managed to get the PRIDE contaminants spectral library into splib format. **@Wout** needs to look at the shared IPython Notebook to assist with running ANN-SoLo from within Python.

## Miscellaneous

- David had a conflicting meeting and is generally busy until the end of the year, but encourages us to keep tagging him for PR reviews of the rmzqc software.
