## Planning

- The document review process for the specification document officially ends on Sept 6. We will receive reviewer feedback a few weeks later.
- We will have our next call in 2 weeks, on August 24. We can skip Sept 7 after that due to some people being unavailable.
- Chris will go on paternity leave until October. Enjoy!

## CV integration

- We had a discussion on CV terms for missing/empty scans and the number of PSMs. We will finalize these metrics via Slack for integration in the PSI-MS CV.

## Software implementations

- rmzqc: Chris is working on some final tests and will then submit the package to CRAN this week. ðŸŽ‰
