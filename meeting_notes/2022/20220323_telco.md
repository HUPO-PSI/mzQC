## HUPO-PSI Spring Meeting

We need to finalize the agenda for QC session at the [PSI Spring Meeting 2022](https://psidev.info/hupo-psi-meeting-2022) (Hinxton, UK; May 11â€“13, 2022).

On Friday, May 13, the morning session will be a discussion concerning the [Global Alliance for Genomics and Health](https://www.ga4gh.org/). We can remove the QC track for the day if people want to attend this session.

## mzQC software implementations

- pymzqc: Mathias will release a new version asap.
    - Reading the PSI-MS CV using Pronto in Python is problematic because the UO doesn't seem to follow the full OBO specification (missing dbxrefs). Mathias has [opened an issue](https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/unit-ontology/issues/44) to try to get the UO fixed.
- rmzqc: No major updates; 2nd PR opened this week.
- Online validator: Mathias has made some small improvements, the pymzqc update is necessary next.

## Controlled vocabulary

Note that browsing of the CV tree hierarchy (e.g. on OLS) only links QC metrics to their value types (i.e. single value, tuple, etc.) because those relationships are specified using the `is_a` mechanism. Other metric categorization is specified using the `relationship` mechanism. These links do show up on OLS, but not in the tree view.

Integration of the QC CV into the PSI-MS CV:

- Not all QC metrics that are used in the examples in the GitHub documentation are in the PSI-MS CV yet.
    - Mathias has opened PRs [#112](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/psi-ms-CV/pull/112) and [#113](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/psi-ms-CV/pull/113) to request some of the missing terms. Discussion is ongoing in the PRs, please have a look and contribute!
    - There are a few more metrics that still need to be proposed. Mathias will open another PR shortly.
    - The way we define PCA-related metrics needs to be updated to be more specific than the current CV term. Chris will propose a CV term with a better definition and update the corresponding examples ([set-of-runs](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/blob/main/doc/set-of-runs.mzQC.md) and [metabo-batches](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/blob/main/doc/metabo-batches.mzQC.md)).
- Mathias has opened a big PR [#175](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/pull/175) with documentation updates.
    - The big PR has been merged.
    - Future issues will be tackled in smaller PRs per individual tasks to keep it more manageable.
