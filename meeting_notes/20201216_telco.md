## mzQC version 1.0

- The specification document has been submitted to the PSI document process. ðŸŽ‰
    - Updated documents are available in the `doc` folder.

### TODO

- Bring the CV up to date.
    - [PR 102](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/pull/102)
    - Discussion of the definition of some new terms: number of proteins, number of PSMs/peptides/proteins at FDR thresholds.
    - Instead of requiring that only metrics that are designated as `Column type` can be used in tables, this should be possible for all metrics. We will not use the explicit `Column type` specification anymore.
- Finalize examples: example mzQC files and an associated narrative in markdown.
    - [Chris] MaxQuant [multi-run example](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/blob/master/doc/multi-run.mzQC.md)
- Finalize companion documents.
