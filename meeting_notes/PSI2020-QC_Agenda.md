# PSI2020 all-virtual conference agenda for QC track
## 1. We need a release-ready CV
AP's:
* Finish outstanding requests
* Formalise requirements and suggestions
* Check all entries against above req&sug
* Hierarchy organisation + visualisation 
* What's missing? 
  - essentials (&organise breakout), 
  - priority *TODO*s (advertise participation/cooperation from/with specific tools/developers that might offer items on the list), 
  - wishlist (if someone wants to join in the future, prepare entry points to work on)

## 2. (companion) documents
This is about targeting the right audience for each document
AP's:
#### 1. Target: Compute-savy MS folks, PIs, Editors, Reviewers
* How does json look like? Then, how does mzQC look like in particular?  (_not_ what is json, that would be too much for people how just want to get an impression)
* How does mzQC get visualised into a report? Which bits in mzQC are most important? 

#### 2. Target: Tool devs, pot. mzQC consumers
* How are metrics organised? 
  - hierarchy
  - definition+explanation requirements
  - data types
  - examples
  - new entries
* Examples of integration with other formats 
  - How are references to/from other formats handled?
* [x] mzQC in 5 minutes
* mzQC in 20 minutes

#### 3. MIAPE-QC
* Who would be thet target audience?
* Are different levels of reports possible, if yes which?
* Can we require values or just certain types of metrics to be assessed?

#### 4. Target: Tool devs that know 2. already, anyone who needs a technical reference
* examples in the specification document (depends on 1.)
* all examples in section6 - revise, check accession, format

#### 5. Target: PSI reviewers, technical people with general hands-on knowledge of computational MS, tool devs
* paragraphs in the specification document (no dependencies)
* use-case descriptions
* why we have metrics with one value and metrics with whole tables of values

#### 6. Target: PSI reviewers, technical people with general hands-on knowledge of computational MS, tool devs
* polish specification document (probably best last)
  - author list, 
  - pending comments, 
  - references, 
  - softwares



> I'd also like to advocate against work on a manuscript _before_ we have mastered all the above tasks. 
We all need to have a clear idea what we are putting forward and substantiate those offerings of mzQC for the community. 
Sure there is still time when we are under PSI-review.
(Also, no dessert before dinner is finished and the kitchen is clean.)
