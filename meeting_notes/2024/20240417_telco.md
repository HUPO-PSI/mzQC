## Working group charter

We went over the [working group charter](https://www.psidev.info/quality-control-working-group-charter) with an eye on its annual update. Some minor updates (affiliation update), but other than that, no major changes are needed.

Our key effort during the next year will be to demonstrate the benefits and applications of mzQC in practice, through the development of use cases and support of QC software.

Wout will update the charter and send it for consultation to Slack.

## CV

- Precursor mass deviation ([#254](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/psi-ms-CV/pull/254)): Good to be merged. Note that FragPipe reports the absolute mass deviation (although not explicitly as a QC metric).
- Number of missed cleavages ([#255](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/psi-ms-CV/pull/255)): Discussion on how to represent this metric and its definition. Mathias will apply some refinements.
- identified MS2 vs RT ([#255](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/psi-ms-CV/pull/255)): Some confusion around what this metric precisely represents, indicating that its definition should be clarified. Mathias will update it in analogy to some existing related terms.

## mzQC software libraries manuscript

- Mathias reported on the updated data analysis workflow (including protein-level FDR control, which necessitated switching search engines).
- Mathias will share the updated data analysis figure with Tim for some visual edits.
- The [JASMS special issue on computational mass spectrometry](https://axial.acs.org/analytical-chemistry/jasms-call-for-papers-special-issue-on-computational-mass-spectrometry) submission deadline is April 30, 2024. We will have an additional meeting next week to finalize the manuscript by this deadline.
