## mzQC software libraries manuscript

- Wout and Mathias plan to finalize and preprint the manuscript, possibly by the end of January.
- The focus will be on updating sections related to methods, datasets, and interpretations in the manuscript.
    - Discussion on updating the dataset and method references in the manuscript.
    - **Mathias** to update all references to the dataset and related methods in the manuscript.
    - **Wout** will review the results section of the manuscript and draft relevant content based on the updated dataset and analyses.
- Harmonization of code snippets in supplementary data is needed. The aim is to have concise, representative code sections rather than complete blocks.
    - Plan to get input from Niels and others for harmonizing these code snippets.
- The final version of the manuscript will be shared with Juanam for review before submission.
