## Miscellaneous

- Nils presented on lipidomics data analysis and mzQC at the EuBIC-MS Winter School, with a positive reception and eagerness within the community regarding QC.

## PSI Spring Meeting

Brief recap of the schedule for the PSI Spring Meeting. The proposed schedule is acceptable, people from Europe will try to join the afternoon sessions depending on availability.

## Specification Document

No response on the resubmitted specification document yet. We should hear something from Silvie soon.

## mzQC software libraries manuscript

Magnus is eager to cite mzQC, so let's get a preprint out. ðŸ™‚

Steps to finalize the manuscript:

- We discussed the data analysis and how to represent the QC metrics in a heat map.
- The methods and results section need to be updated accordingly. No need to (over)interpret the data, just factually describe the QC metrics without trying to explain potential quality degradations.
- We need to ensure that all QC metrics are included in the CV.
- Action items: Check that the code snippets in the supplementary are self-contained and consistent.
