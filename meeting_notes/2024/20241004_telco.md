## CV updates

- Chris has been working on requested CV updates for DIA-related QC terms derived from DIA-NN output.
- Wout reviewed the PR and requested minor changes.

## mzQC website updates

- Wout walked through the website restructuring, with content divided between users (use cases for mzQC) and developers (technical information and metrics).
- There is still work to be done on refining the content, especially in tracking the evolving metrics and providing proper resources for each audience.

## mzQC validator updates and edge cases

- There are some edge cases in the validator that need attention, particularly regarding validation of the units of the metrics.
- Wout suggested that updates are required to ensure accurate validation of examples, which is being tracked via GitHub.

## Support for mzQC in tools

- The team discussed the support for mzQC in various tools and how this is listed on the website, noting that it is inconsistent.
- Wout highlighted the comprehensive documentation on some tools as exemplary but agreed it's unfeasible to replicate for all tools.
- Julian and Wout agreed that it would be overwhelming to maintain detailed information about which tools support specific metrics, suggesting instead a higher-level overview.
- The team discussed linking out to existing detailed documentation rather than recreating it on their platform.
- A plan was proposed to categorize tools by their use (e.g., proteomics, DDA, DIA, metabolomics).

## mzQC manuscript

- Wout noted that work on the manuscript has slowed down a bit, and have not set a concrete submission deadline yet.
- Initial discussions aimed for completion by the end of 2024, but progress may push submission into early 2025.
- Tim suggested blocking dedicated time (e.g., 3 days) to finalize the manuscript, which has been a successful strategy in the past.
