# QC working group teleconference 7 August 2024

- Wout Bittremieux
- Mathias Walzer

## CV

We noticed an inconsist usage of `fraction` with relationship `has_units` and relationship `is_value_concept`.
After discussion we determined that we will harmonize this with `has_units` relationships, because QC terms that take a value are required to have a unit, as per the spec doc.

## mzQC website

- Some of the validator issues raised by Wout in the mzQC examples PRs might be due to an older deployed version of the validator, with fixes already implemented by Mathias (i.e. mzIdentML files for ID-based metrics).
- Discussion of the QC2 and metabolomics batch correction examples to iron out some final kinks. Wout has requested CV updates for the former and Mathias will address the latter.
- We have merged the website documentation update. **TODO @all:** review the changes online, to be discussed during the next call.
