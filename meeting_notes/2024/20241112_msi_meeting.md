Discussion on the implementation, utility, and future developments of the mzQC file format for QC in MS imaging.

Theodore, Chris, and Kumar are experts in MS imaging and have developed QC methods in the context of the NIH-funded Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP).

- Their QC methods currently include instrument calibration, tissue handling, and spectral alignment. Metrics like ion image correlation and signal delocalization were discussed as potential additions to mzQC.
- The imaging community's contributions and metric standards could help shape the ongoing development of mzQC.

**Next steps**

- Wout will share detailed information on mzQC and example files.
- Theodore will lead export of MS imaging QC metrics to mzQC, based on existing software developed and used in the KPMP. We will need to coordinate integration of relevant metrics within the PSI-MS CV.
- We will begin with current KPMP developed metrics from existing workflows, exporting these as mzQC files to demonstrate utility and gather feedback.
- This will then be included in the mzQC manuscript as an additional use case on QC for MS imaging.
- Future efforts can involve detailed discussions on how mzQC can support a QC ecosystem for MS imaging and cultivate further tool development, as well as potential integration in Metaspace.
