## In-person meeting mzQC manuscript

- **Proposal:** Block 2â€“3 days in January for an in-person meeting in Antwerp to focus solely on the manuscript, with remote attendance as an option.
- **Funding:** Wout has budget available for travel and accommodation for international researchers.
- **Decision:** A Doodle poll will be circulated to determine suitable dates, likely in January (preferably the second or third week).

## Website

- The examples on the website are mostly updated, with batch correction still needing review and link checks.
- Wout will review the batch correction example.
- A few issues remain, mainly related to the validator (e.g. missing CV references) and some broken links. All examples need to be double checked.

## pymzqc validator

- The validator needs updates, including proper error handling for missing ontology terms.
- Mathias will work on validator code adjustments and prepare a new pymzqc release.
    - Team members might be asked for assistance during testing.

## mzQC manuscript

Discussion of use cases:

- **Longitudinal analysis:** Preference for QCloud data due to its richness and metadata on instrument maintenance.
- **MS imaging:** Potential collaboration with the MS imaging group at FU Berlin can't apply for funding currently. Wout should reach out to Theodore Alexandrov to inquire about QC practices in MS imaging.

## Miscellaneous

- Mathias's EBI account will close next week. Essential files on the shared Google Drive need to be reviewed and migrated.
    - Mathias will check files for potential transfer to GitHub or alternative storage.
    - Team to review the list and provide feedback on which files to retain or discard.
