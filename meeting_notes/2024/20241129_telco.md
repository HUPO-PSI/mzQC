## mzQC and Unit Ontology issues

- Context:
    - CV ambiguities with overlapping terms between PSI-MS CV and UO.
    - Historical reasons for duplications in PSI-MS CV due to temporary UO unavailability.
- Decisions:
    - Avoid unnecessarily importing UO in mzQC files if its duplicated terms in the PSI-MS CV suffice.
    - Document implementation practices for handling UO terms on the project website.
- Action items:
    - Update mzQC validator to ensure unitless terms remain unitless unless explicitly required.
    - Enforce strict definitions of metrics and associated units to avoid ambiguities.
    - Review documentation to clarify dependencies on PSI-MS CV and UO.
