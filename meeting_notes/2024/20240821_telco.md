## Website updates

- Discussion on recent updates to the website, including changes to various pages like metrics, specifications, use cases, and validation processes.
- Identified some inconsistencies and incomplete updates on the website, particularly in the metrics section.

### Navigation and structure

- The current navigation menu was found to be confusing due to redundant links and overlapping content.
- Remove redundant links from the top menu and ensure that each menu item corresponds to a single, clear page.
- Rename some menu items for clarity, such as changing "Format" to "Introduction" or "Overview" under the "For Users" section.

## Categorization

- The idea to create two main categories: "For Developers" and "For Users," was discussed to differentiate between technical and non-technical content.
- "For Developers" would include technical documentation, specifications, and validation, while "For Users" would focus on use cases and software applications.
    - Move less technical content, such as omics-specific information, to the "For Users" section, and keep technical documentation under "For Developers."

## Content specificity

- Consideration of the need to separate content specific to different types of omics (proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics) to better target different communities.
- Discussion on the importance of keeping examples and use cases up to date and consistent with the current specifications.
    - Ensure that the example files are automatically validated using GitHub Actions.

## Action items

Content review and update:

- Review and update the metrics page to ensure completeness and accuracy.
- Create a standalone "Use Cases" page separate from the omics content.

Navigation overhaul:

- Redesign the website navigation to reflect the new categorization, ensuring a clear distinction between developer-focused and user-focused content.
- Rename menu items as discussed (e.g., "Format" to "Introduction" or "Overview").

Technical improvements:

- Implement a semantic validation process in GitHub actions to automatically check the correctness of examples and other technical content.
- Explore possible solutions for ensuring link validity and overall content consistency on the website.
