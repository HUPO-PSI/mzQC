## mzQC examples

- We went over the updated mzQC examples and had a discussion on related CV requests.
- Wout will submit new CV requests to complete the [setQuality](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/pull/219) and [mzML](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/pull/228) examples.
    - MS:4000177|protein contaminant intensity ratio should use the "ratio" unit instead of "fraction".
- Additional checks need to be added to the validator: [ensure unit consistency](https://github.com/MS-Quality-Hub/pymzqc/issues/42), [input files to recognize ID-based metrics](https://github.com/MS-Quality-Hub/pymzqc/issues/43), [documentation on how to run locally](https://github.com/MS-Quality-Hub/pymzqc/issues/44).
- The validator seems to be online again but very slow. Mathias will work on validator documentation and coordinate with Nils for stability issues.

## mzQC manuscript

- Eralp joined us for some fresh perspectives on the manuscript and use cases. We especially discussed the longitudinal QC use case. We can use QCloud data or CPTAC data, which Eralp has used previously with MsStatsQC.
- Eralp and Mathias will coordinate to decide on the best dataset to use for the longitudinal QC use case.
- Eralp will look into mzQC support for MsStatsQC through rmzqc. Alternately, a simpler first approach could be to use an external conversion script.
- Wout will create a Python script to convert between QuaMeter output and mzQC.

## Miscellaneous

- Wout & Dave will be present at HUPO 2024 in Dresden.
