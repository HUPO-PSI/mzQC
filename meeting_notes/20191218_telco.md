## Specification document

- Mathias has worked some more on the specification document, but it isn't entirely finished yet.
- Once finished, the specification document will be sent to the working group for an internal review prior to submission to the PSI document process.

## mzQC Python library

- The Python library got moved to its own repository: [xxx](TODO).
- Mathias has created a 5 minutes guide to mzQC. Check out the very nice [interactive notebook here](TODO).
    - He has a student who's working with Mathias's libraries to do QC on PRIDE.
- We need to implement more semantic checks and document them on the website and in the specification document.
- The Python library can be used to provide an online mzQC validator.

## Examples

- We need to provide examples. Dave has used an iPRG dataset (?) in the past that might be suitable.
- We need to make sure we have a non-proteomics example as well. Reza shared some figures from metabolomics pooled QC samples on Slack. He will provide the actual data in February so we can store the QC metrics in an mzQC file.

## Action points

- Mathias: Finalize the specification document.
- General: Update the website.
- Wout: Implement semantic checks in the Python library.
- Dave: Provide information on the iPRG example dataset.
- Reza: Share the metabolomics QC data.
