## Specification document

The specification document is close to completion. We just need to address some final comments before we can submit it to the document process.

- [ACTION] We should point to the mzQC JSON Schema to validate mzQC files.
- Section 2.1: How much detail is necessary about the comparison between XML and JSON? Two audiences for the specification document: (i) people who are familiar with qcML and might wonder why we switched, and (ii) the HUPO-PSI members, who are more familiar with XML. A high-level conceptual overview of why JSON is a better fit is sufficient.
- [ACTION Mathias] Section 5.3 page 14: Dense text, adding a figure can make this clearer.

## Companion documents

- Reza and Mathias are working on a metabolomics example by converting a spreadsheet with QC metrics from an existing paper to an mzQC file.

## CV

The CV needs to be updated based on the current open PRs, and we need to check that the latest changes are correctly described in the specification document (for example, specifying units using `has_units`).

## Misc

Our next call will be October 7, 2020.
