## Miscellaneous

Mathias has created a visual representation of mzQC that can function as a gentle introduction to reel people in. The figure should additionally try to communicate why mzQC is useful.

## Specification document

- Matrix metric type: We will create a dummy example for illustration purposes, it is not necessary to have a real matrix metric generated by a tool.
- Metric names: Names are recommended to consist of alphanumeric, whitespace, and punctuation 7-bit ASCII characters only.
- Metrics without a value: We will punt on a "no value" tag in the CV for later if it becomes useful.
- Unit types: Mathias has included examples of `has_type` tags in the specification document.
- Metric unit: Remove outdated sentence that the unit in an mzQC file can optionally differ from the unit that's specified in the CV.
- Quantitative CV: We don't want to mention explicitly that we don't support that yet. mzQC is versatile enough to do support it.

We want to initiate the PSI document process within two weeks!

## Example mzQC files

- Example files needed: single file, multiple files, metabolomics.
- Mathias will generate files using his QC-Calculator.
- If the example files aren't available yet prior to starting the PSI document process we can just use placeholders.
