## PSI review process

Documents that are part of the review process:

- Specification document.
- At least 3 examples.
- Well-rounded purpose of the format.

## Specification document

- Slight deviations from the PSI template and there is some content duplication between the abstract and short summary. We will move important phrases from the short summary to the abstract and remove the former.
- We will move the notational conventions as the second section.
- `inputFile`: What is the format and uniqueness of the `name` attribute?

## Example files

- Single run simple example: https://gist.github.com/mwalzer/32c4573cd0a23295e955bdfd607561fa
    - Keep it simple, only a few metrics from a single run.
- Multiple runs: https://gist.github.com/mwalzer/03ce398cfb0ea907ea871342d796acf8
- MaxQuant example of groups of input files: MaxQuant computes some properties based on groups of files.
    - How to define a group? In the metadata (as opposed to as a QC metric).
- Pooled QCs: The mixture content is a QC metric.
