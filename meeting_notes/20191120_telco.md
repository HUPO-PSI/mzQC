## Specification document

A first draft of the specification document is available [here](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/blob/spec-doc/spec_doc/mzQC_specDoc_v_0_1_0.docx).

Discussion:

- Do we need a CV mailing list, similar to the mailing for the MS CV? Our current guidelines detail how to request CV terms via GitHub. People who don't have a GitHub account can request CV terms via our general mailing list, we don't need a separate mailing list for CV maintenance.
- Section 5.3 & 5.4: How can we reference information from mzML and mzIdentML files inside the mzQC files?
    - We have a section to specify input files.
    - File names can change. Section 6.1.14 specifies that a checksum should be provided.
    - We can reference individual spectra using USIs (for external spectra) or nativeIDs (for internal use; see e.g. the mzTab specification).
- Experimental design: How the specify biological and technical replicates, or groups in general?
    - [mzQuantML](https://doi.org/10.1074/mcp.O113.028506) has a full specification for groups.
    - Ontology terms can be used to specify detailed information in the metadata section. Example: [EFO:0000683 -> replicate](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/EFO_0000683).
    - setQuality explicitly specifies aggregated metrics.

Mathias and Dave will iterate further on the specification document.

## CV readme

The readme detailing the CV procedures has not been updated yet. Julian just became a father, so he has a more than valid excuse. Congrats Julian!

An [issue](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/94) has been created.

## Call schedule

Our new schedule for the monthly call will be every third Wednesday of the month. Our next call will be on Wednesday December 18th.
