## MSstatsQC

Eralp Dogu, developer of MSstatsQC, joined our call.

Brief overview of MSstatsQC:

- Published in [MCP](https://www.mcponline.org/content/16/7/1335) and [JPR](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00732).
- Available as an [R package](http://msstats.org/msstatsqc/).
- MSstatsQC is a metric consumer as opposed to a metric producer: it applies statistical detection methods for QC using a csv file from Skyline as input, while being agnostic to the type of metric.

Interesting datasets:

- [Longitudinal SRM data](https://panoramaweb.org/MSstatsQC.url) from the MCP publication.
- Data from [Biognosys QuiC](https://www.biognosys.com/products/easy-to-use-qc-monitor-for-main-proteomics-workflows) used in the JPR publication.

## Roadmap to mzQC v1

Mathias started to compile an [action plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1929qzGTuXmIdUTHCqMuLhrYgUh0e6OIejX6fY38QHHU/edit#gid=0).

### Outstanding issue: Pull request #67

Mathias copied [Julian's original PR](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/pull/65) to a branch under the mzQC repository so other people can contribute to it: [PR #67](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/pull/67).

- We don't need to include external OBOs in the mzQC repository. Such OBOs are already mentioned as imports in the QC CV, and, for example, the [Pronto Python library](https://pronto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to process ontologies can resolve those imports.

### Semantic validation

- Mathias did some work on a Python package as a reference implementation and for semantic validation (not publicly available yet). **TODO**: Synchronize these efforts with code already developed by Wout ([pymzqc](https://github.com/bittremieux/pymzqc)).
- [Issue #51](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/51) provides an overview of all semantic checks. Use this issue to collect all relevant semantic checks for easy reference when writing the specification document.
	- The `unit` of a `cvParameter` is a `cvParameter` itself: this can lead to an infinite recursion of `cvParameter`s. We have to make it clear in the specification document that `unit`s _cannot_ have child `cvParameter`s and this has to be verified during the semantic validation.
	- Because not all terms in the CV are metrics the semantic validation should check that `qualityParameter`s actually refer to terms in the CV that describe metrics. The `part_of` relationship can be used in the CV to specify which terms are required.

### Repository improvements

The repository should be cleaned and improved so that users can easily find the relevant information. A few action points were identified last month based on feedback from Chris:

- Clear and consistent naming and folder structure.
- Real examples generated by QC software: different datasets (iPRG, CPTAC, ...), use cases, software.
- Explain the structure of the CV on the website and in the specification document.
- Explain why we use a JSON format as opposed to the more typical XML formats.

Mathias started a cleanup branch (currently still private) to get started on this.

### Referencing in mzQC files

We briefly mentioned two considerations regarding referencing elements in mzQC files:

- Currently a `run`/`setQuality`s are arrays of `qualityParameter`s. If this would be a dictionary instead it would be possible to retrieve metrics directly using their accession.
- Should all of the metrics in a `setQuality` be present in the corresponding `runQuality`?

## Call schedule

Calls are currently scheduled on a monthly basis. As we're approaching the 1.0 specification, there was a proposal to increase the call frequency to bi-weekly, possibly switching between a general call and a more technical call.

Instead we will use Slack to directly communicate with each other. Mathias has created the [HUPO-PSI Slack workspace](https://hupo-psi.slack.com/). Please contact Mathias to get an invitation.
