## ASMS reflections

- People are starting to recognize the efforts from our working group.
- There were a few posters on small QC tools. For example: Tartare (RawMeat successor), ...

## JSON format

- We need to settle on a standardized naming scheme (lower case vs camel case, underscores, ...).
- JSON doesn't natively support comments so for the moment we have used a `__comment` key-value pair instead.
- Proposal for the file name extension is `.mzqc.json` replacing the previous `.qcml`.

## CV

Discussion on using additional OBO files to let tool developers have quick access to new CV terms, for example for QCloud development. We can integrate their metrics but maintain close ties with core tool developers and let them administrate their CV terms themselves.

## Action points

- Translate our previous qcML examples to the JSON format, including examples of all data types that were identified during the Heidelberg meeting (single metric, array, matrix, data frame).
