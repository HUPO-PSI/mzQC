## Current state of the qcML format

- [CV](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/qcML-development/blob/master/cv/v0_0_10/qc-cv.obo): obo file based on Martin's initial Excel file
- [Handcrafted example](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/qcML-development/blob/master/schema/v0_0_10/handcrafted_example.qcml)
    - Every entry is defined by a CV term: metrics, metadata, ...
    - Specific elements in the file
        - `runQuality`: describes a single run
        - `setQuality`: combines multiple runs
        - `metadata`: lists input files (raw, identifications, quant, other)
            - If a qcML file refers to an mzML file which was generated from a raw file should we list this raw file as well?
        - `qualityParameter`: individual metrics as single value, tuple, or table
            - single value: XML attribute (~ other PSI standards)
            - tuple: JSON tuple including a unit
            - Should we have an explicit element for quadruples instead of the more general n-tuples? To be discussed.
        - `cv`: links to the CVs with definitions
            - QC: CV compiled by our working group
            - MS: general PSI-MS CV
            - UO: unit ontology

### TODO

- Create mock-ups of what a qcML file from multiple software sources would look like:
    - QuaMeter: Dave
    - OpenMS: Mathias
    - iMonDB: Wout
    - meta-analysis of multiple qcML files: Wout
- Specify how qcML would be used within our workflows

### XML vs JSON

Can we just use JSON exclusively instead of mixing it with XML?

Pro JSON-only:

- Straightforward API usage
- Convenient parsers in many programming languages

Pro XML-JSON mix:

- Minimum level of consistency with other PSI formats

## MIAPE-QC

Jinmeng will prepare an example paragraph that meets the MIAPE-QC expectations which we hope to see in future published manuscripts.

â†’ Cross-reference the MIAPE-QC terms to the QC-CV.

## CV

The CV will still need some work:

- Missing value types
- Incomplete `is_a` links across multiple terms
- Definitions need to be updated

We have scheduled a day to work on the CV in Heidelberg.
