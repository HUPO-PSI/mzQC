## CV

Julian has started compiling the new CV based on the example files. Check out pull request #44 for his progress.

- Old CV terms have been removed. The new CV terms have an accession number starting with `QC:4000`.
- The names of some CV terms have been changed to be more general (for example no more "QuaMeter" prefix).
- The dimension of the CV term (n-tuples and tables) can be specified with `cv_value`.
- A "QC metric basis" is used to specify whether a metric is ID-based, ID-free, quantification, ... This might be removed because these distinctions are often arbitrary.

**TODO for everyone:** Provide your feedback to Julian. Check the new CV to see whether the names and definitions are correct.

## Miscellaneous

- Dave will organize a full-day workshop on QC in Johannesburg next week. Have fun!
- The PSI steering committee will decide on the location for next year's meeting soon. Cape Town is still in the running so fingers crossed.
