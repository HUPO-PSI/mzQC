## CV

- Julian will add new CV entries for the terms requested by Dave and Roger.
- Mathias will check with the Barcelona people whether they can successfully use the old accessions for validation in their software.

## QC for SWATH

- SwaMe: Dave's student is working on a new version of QuaMeter that will produce QC metrics for SWATH experiments in the mzQC format
- SWATH scans consist of 20-30 fixed m/z intervals which would result in tabular metrics with 20-30 columns.

## mzQC format

How to reference `runQualities` in a `setQuality`?
- Via the file name. See the [example](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/blob/json-schema/schema/v0_0_11/examples/iPRG2015_sample1.qc.json).
- Introduce explicit references:
	- Define an explicit anchor in each `runQuality`
	- Or use a hierarchy
Discuss this in [pull request #48](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/pull/48).

## MIAPE

Reza remarked that some MIAPE terms are very general and re-use of other MIAPE definitions might be possible.

## Miscellaneous

- The GitHub repository has been renamed from `qcML-development` to `mzQC`.
- Mathias proposed some edits to the working group charter. Dave will finalize the update to the charter.
- The 2019 spring meeting will take place in Cape Town, South Africa (hosted by Dave) in the week of March 11th.
