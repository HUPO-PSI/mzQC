## Introduction

- Mathias gave a brief introduction about our choice for JSON versus XML.
- Mathias ran us through an example mzQC file.

## mzQC format

### Multi-dimensional metrics

How can we represent multi-dimensional metrics?

Example use case: spiked-in peptides:

seq    | rt   | m/z   
------ | ---- | ------
AELVNK | 1584 | 1200.2
HEAVR  | 2012 | 784.3
TLVANK | 2517 | 586.2

&rarr; This example [QC parameter in the mzQC format](https://gist.github.com/bittremieux/8bb136fcec42236b14964f5658bcbf58).

Minimal schema changes are needed to encode multidimensional metrics this way:

- The `unit` needs to be converted from a single `cvParameter` to a list of `cvParameter`s.
- The semanic validator needs to check that the list lengths are identical ([#51](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/51)).

An additional example file containing SWATH metrics in a matrix was compiled by Paul. **TODO**: Share and finalize this example mzQC file.

### References between `run`/`setQualities`

How can we refer to `runQualities` and `setQualities` in downstream `setQualities`?

See for example the following situation with a dependency between multiple `runQualities` and `setQualities`:

- Initial `runQuality` with metrics for a single fractionated run.
- `setQuality` level 1 with metrics for all fractions of a single sample.
- `setQuality` level 2 with longitudinal metrics for all samples over time.

Currently the file names of input files are used as reference for multi-file metrics. However, when multiple `runQualities` and `setQualities` are present in a single mzQC file this breaks down.

Instead Timo, Mathias, and Wout worked out an example file with internal references using [JSON pointers](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901) across `runQualities` and `setQualities` in a single file. This general referencing system fully substitutes the previous referencing system, even in the simple case when file names are available.

**TODO**: Share and finalize the referencing example mzQC file.

## Github issues

We addressed several open [issues on the mzQC Github repository](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues):

- [Availability in software packages](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/2): Discussed during the Wednesday session.
- [ProteomeXchange interface](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/3): Link this to the [ELIXIR crowd-sourcing implementation study](https://www.elixir-europe.org/about-us/implementation-studies/crowd-sourcing-proteomics).
- [Reference dataset](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/4) / [example file](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/11): The dataset from Marina's outlier detection tutorial is a good option ([PXD006843](http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD006843)).
- [Logo](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/16): Dave will try to create a fancy ray-traced logo, Brandon had some good suggestions about modern logo development.
- [Readme and wiki](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/18): We need to create a specification document (in Markdown). This should be prioritized because it will be the main resource for developers.
- [Specify experiment type for the metrics](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/24): Not necessary to explicitly store the type of experiment, this will depend on the tool used to compute QC metrics.
- [Raw file information](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/34): File checksums etc. have been included in the format. We should detail in the specification document that ideally raw file URIs should be accessible and that public URIs are preferred, with the caveat that this is only possible for published datasets.
- [Provenance](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/36): Recommend in the specification document that the full bioinformatics workflow should be recorded. Full MIAPE details for provenance will be too hard to enforce.
- [Bioinformatics identification data](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/38): Opt-in of detailed information in the MIAPE is better than enforcing it in the file format to avoid being overly restrictive. This doesn't need to be explicitly stored in the mzQC files. Refer to the MIAPE in the specification document.
- [Intra-document references](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/50): We will use JSON pointers (see above) as internal references. This needs to be clearly described in the specification document.
- [Semantic validation](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/51): Wout described the [Python semantic validator](https://github.com/bittremieux/pymzqc). Any additional semantic validation steps should be added to the active issue. The validator will need to report warnings/errors at different levels, rather than stopping executing at the first error it encounters.
- [Length of CV value lists](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/57): We don't need to explicitly specify the length of multi-value metrics, this will rather be determined implicitly from the metric content. If some metric explicitly requires a fixed number of elements we will create a unique CV term for it.
- [Request CV terms without GitHub account](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/59): CV terms can be requested by sending an email to the mailing list.

## CV commitment plan

CV status:

- Julian recently cleaned the CV.
- We need to make sure that all metrics from example files etc. are present in the CV ([#56](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/56)).
- We need to check that all terms are suitably defined.
- Relationships to other CVs have recently been added (i.e. PSI-MS, [#54](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/54)). Further links can be investigated.

## MIAPE-QC

[Current MIAPE-QC document](https://github.com/Jinmeng-QC/MIAPE-QC/blob/master/MIAPE-QC_draft.md)

### MIAPE content

Which information to include in the MIAPE?

- Collect existing SOPs from labs and the literature. Core facilities have very standardized procedures that can function as a starting point.
- Cross-check with existing MIAPEs to avoid overlap/duplication.
- The MIAPE template will function as a decision tree: based on actions taken additional information will be required. This decision tree should ideally be hidden from the user to avoid overwhelming them, instead an interactive wizard should be developed.
- Add references to the (publicly accessible) corresponding mzQC file(s).

## MIAPE in action

How will people use the MIAPE-QC for their own publications? A short description of the MIAPE in the Methods section, with full details added as supplementary information.

Layout of the MIAPE:

1. Sample and materials
2. Experimental design
3. Chronological order of elements described in 1. and 2. In current manuscripts this is typically squeezed together. For clarity, instead we will break everything up in self-contained blocks that correspond with the different steps in the experimental procedure.

### MIAPE whitepaper

We will need to prepare two different manuscripts:

- MIAPE whitepaper
- Peer-reviewed publication

The MIAPE whitepaper will have to be detailed and clearly provide a reasoning why all requested information is relevant. For example, why specify when the urea was prepared? Because urea that has been allowed to age can lead to unexpected carbamylation modifications.
On the other hand, we don't want to make the whitepaper too dense and long because then no one will read it. We will need to find a careful balance between general guidelines that are too vague and unconvincing, and requesting every single detail.

## mzQC use cases

We don't only need to support the typical DDA shotgun metrics, but also alternative use cases such as MALDI profiling, ...

Representatives for different use cases:

- Shotgun: Mathias, Dave
- SWATH: Dave
- MALDI profiling: Hugo Lopez-Fernandez
- SRM: Meena Choi
- GC-MS: Oliver Fiehn

How can people use mzQC to do quality control?

- Outlier detection: Published algorithms by Dave & Wout (proteomics), metabolomics.
- Longitudinal performance monitoring: Case study for SWATH nicely illustrated by Paul. Potential analysis techniques include Shewhart process control chart, Hotelling TÂ².
- QC and QA are not often distinguished from each other in our field. (Also: decision support for people coming from a medicine background.)

## QC tools ecosystem

Which tools generate and/or consume mzQC files? Existing support and future developments:

1. mzQC generators
	- Shotgun
		- OpenMS-Rudnick
		- QuaMeter ID-free
	- SWATH / DIA
		- QuaMeter SwaMe
		- Paul's scripts
	- SRM
		- MSstats
2. mzQC consumers
	- iMonDB

A rich set of tools supporting mzQC is asbolutely essential for community adoption! User-friendly visualization software will be important.

### Use case analysis

We described user stories inspired by software engineering to evaluate who the mzQC users are and what their requirements are. Who are the actors? What do they want?

- Actor: researcher.
- Requirement: I want to compute QC metrics from my data.
- Aim: I want to see if my experiment functioned well.

- Actor: MS technician
- Requirement: I want to do longitudinal monitoring.
- Aim: I want to make sure my instrument consistently operates correctly.

## Implementation in repositories

mzQC file generation in repositories (i.e. PRIDE) in multiple situations:

- At upload time: Automatically generate ID-free metrics. 
- At download time: Metrics to verify the data quality for reanalysis, inclding ID and quantification-based metrics.

## Action points

- Wout: Update the JSON schema to have a list of `unit`s.
- Wout: Add new checks to the semantic validator ([#51](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/51)).
- Paul: Finalize and share the example mzQC snippet containing SWATH metrics in a matrix.
- Timo/Mathias/Wout: Finalize and share the example mzQC file demonstrating internal references.
- Dave/Timo: Contact Meena Choi in April about mzQC export in MSstats/MSstatsQC. Timo can address this in person with her when he's visiting Boston next month for the [computational proteomics course](https://computationalproteomics.ccis.northeastern.edu/).
- Dave: Contact Oliver Fiehn to inquire how we can support GC-MS metabolomics in mzQC and advertise this to the metabolomics community.
- Mathias: Align source data for CVs with Yasset's metadata efforts.
