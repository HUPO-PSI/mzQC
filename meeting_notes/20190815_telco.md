## CV

[Pull request #71](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/pull/71):

- Categorize the metrics based on the accession number vs consecutive accession numbers?
    - Categorization is hard! It's more convenient to stick to consecutive accession.
    - Metric hierarchies can be created using relationships to group metrics in families.
    - We don't want to enforce a hierarchy because this is a barrier for new tool authors, instead we will recommend to use a hierarchy. Authors are asked to provide descriptions, we will use our expert knowledge on the CV to find the proper location in the hierarchy.
    - We need more diverse descriptors than we currently have. For example, gel-based isn't supported at the moment (different from the typical LC). Julian will develop better descriptions and solicit feedback from the group.
- Julian is creating an issue template to request new CV terms. The aforementioned hierarchy information will be included in this template.
- Some useful ontologies that we might be able to reuse: [NCIt](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/ncit), NPO. ([#73](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/73))

## Schema

- Where are the advanced examples that were compiled during the spring meeting.
- There are several issues on GitHub to make some minor improvements to the JSON Schema.
    - A creation date for the mzQC file has been added.
    - Naming consistency for lists: runQuality -> runQualities.
    - Naming consistency: CV -> controlledVocabularies
    - Proper naming for metrics: qualityParameter -> qualityMetric
    - Optional item: file provenance. Which information do we want about the input data? For example, which software was used to generate the peak lists, what were the peak picking settings, etc.?
- Currently CVs consist of key-value pairs. This is a weird way to represent this, introduces duplication, and complicates (de)serialization. Instead we should have a normal list of CV items.
- Mathias will include the schema changes in [#79](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/pull/79).
- Mathias's Python library is ready to go! ([#78](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/pull/78)) This allows us to validate mzQC files and makes it easy to create new ones.

## Reference implementations

- Dave still hasn't heard back from Michael Bereman (SProCop).
- Dave is collaborating with Eral (MSStatsQC).
- Paul Brack is developing Yamato/Prognosticator/SwaMe.

## TODO

- Add our action items for the mzQC 1.0 roadmap to the [Gantt chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1929qzGTuXmIdUTHCqMuLhrYgUh0e6OIejX6fY38QHHU/edit#gid=0).
