## ASMS workshop

Intro

- Skit (Dave & Wout): No changes.
- Presentation contemporary QC (Wout): (i) Current status of QC, (ii) QC in the (near) future (can we leverage repositories for QC, e.g. for recognizing common contaminants?).

QC bingo

- Add relevant terms to the [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L5UUHCsv4Uugsccd37_cgoCbWfilBNhcmw9lB5oUzic/edit?usp=sharing). Wout will then generate random bingo cards.
- Bingo interspersed during workshop program. The first person that manages to get a line during conversation wins!

Videos

- PTX-QC (Chris): Dave will contact Chris to inquire about the status.
- Equipment Monitor (Paul): Paul no longer works in the lab, but Richward Unwin (lab manager) will record a video of the Equipment Monitor running next to the mass specs. Brief testimonial of Richard why this is useful and a screencast by Paul to show how it works.
- mzqc-pylib (Mathias): Mathias has an outline and will create his video.

Demo

- Assurance (Dave): Pick the best dataset.

## QC CV integration with MS CV

- [Issue #141 with necessary tasks](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/141)
- [Active pull request #145](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/pull/145)

Status of the CV merge:

- Mathias has started modifying the CV.
- **TODO everyone**: Review the changes. Especially pay attention that there are no duplicates in the CV compared to the MS CV and alternative CVs (use [OLS](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/index)). See Slack for Mathias's message.
- Public review of the specification document is currently on hold until the CV has been merged.

- Next meeting will be October 27. We will go over all material for the ASMS workshop then!
- Dave and Eric Deutsch will give a presentation on current and future activities of the HUPO-PSI at the [HUPO 2021 ReCONNECT conference](https://hupo2021.org/bioinformatics-hub/) on November 10.
