## Semantic metabolomics

[Semantic metabolomics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18xQvGRKCWuA4tf1iS2UNbn1sNK39iLpNFhr5R8nurkc/edit) = (unfortunately unfunded) ELIXIR effort to integrate semantic technologies in metabolomics databases.

1. Add semantic annotations into computational metabolomics frameworks.
    - More reasoning than just a dumb data matrix.
2. Linked data graphs.
    - Use RDF/[JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) to answer biological questions with semantic databases.
3. Promote the use of metabolomics ontologies.
    - Unify metabolomics ontologies.
4. Semantic quality control.
    - Prototype mzQC reporting for metabolomics.

Recommended mzQC improvements:

- Easy browsing of the CV. Currently only the raw OBO is available, better to submit to the [OLS](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/index) and create a navigable HTML version.
    - Nils has [scripts](https://github.com/nilshoffmann/obo-adoc) to convert an OBO file to HTML.
- Add more hierarchical structure to the CV.

Other QC efforts in metabolomics:

- [Metabolomics QA & QC Consortium](https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/Consortia/mQACC/): Promote best practice examples with templates.
- [MetaboLights](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/): Efforts to perform QC at repository scale. Now requires uploads of blanks and CV of internal standards.
- [ReDU](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-0916-7) metadata tagging.
- Relevant QC metrics for metabolomics: CVs across a range of compounds.

Potential QC examples:

- Repository mining: [contaminants](https://maconda.bham.ac.uk/about.php), PEG, extent of oxidation, internal carbamidomethylation.
    - It can be challenging to define universal metrics at a repository scale that are more informative than just "additional" metadata. Potentially related to identification results via automated reprocessing of the data.
- Online monitoring of lab performance: Important use case, few existing systems (QCloud, Panorama AutoQC, [PhenoMeNal](https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giy149)).

## SDRF-Proteomics

Yasset gave an introduction to [SDRF-Proteomics](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00376):

- SDRF can inform different levels of QC: sample > biological replicate > technical replicate > run.
- Compare experimental data with configuration values: E.g. does the mass accuracy match the specified tolerances?
- SDRF does not contain information about blanks or run order. But the run timestamp can be extracted from the raw files, which are referenced to the SDRF sample annotations.

## Future of the Quality Control Working Group

Working group tasks and milestones:

1. Specification 1.0: April 15
2. mzQC manuscript
    - Organize regular writing meetings to finalize the manuscript.
3. Library support
    - There is existing Python support by Mathias.
    - Preliminary R has been developed by Chris.
    - Nils has implemented a basic Java library: [jmzqc](https://github.com/lifs-tools/jmzqc).
    - Missing: .NET support, (web-based) viewer.
4. Field QC CV updates.
5. MIAPE-QC / QC best practices manuscript
    - Content: What kinds of criteria are needed for QC? Establish different levels to specify the extent that best practices are followed.
    - It is desirable to have such a manuscript to educate the community, but it is also challenging to do right.
6. Liaise with the metabolomics community.
    - Reach out to the MSI Metabolomics Standards Initiative.
7. Manuscript on repository-scale QC.
    - Benefit of mzQC at the repository level.
    - Crawl open data to illustrate QC issues.
8. mzQC 2.0
    - Remain ready to update the format as needed.
9. Outreach
    - Propose to organize an evening workshop at ASMS.
    - Be mindful of additional opportunities to demonstrate mzQC.

## mzQC manuscript

Brainstorming and drafting the [mzQC manuscript](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fYPqDBqFamcjXlzX0RMStPOKQD4aHlQd9JHJAfqcjqs/edit).

- Key = find diverse and convincing use cases.
    - Increasing data volume: single scan (ScanRanker) > single experiment with multiple conditions (PTXQC) > longitudinal monitoring (Paul) & outlier detection (Dave) > cross-laboratory comparison (QCloud) > repository-scale QC (PRIDE)
    - Different types of MS: shotgun proteomics (easy), untargeted metabolomics, DIA/SWATCH (SwaMe), SRM (MSStatsQC), labeling experiments, MALDI profiling (Mass-Up)
