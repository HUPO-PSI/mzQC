## Controlled vocabulary

- Julian will address the currently open requests for new CV terms on GitHub. This will allow us to have a somewhat complete CV prior to the merge with the PSI-MS CV.
- Mathias has sent an email to the PSI-MS mailing list to start the conversation on merging the CV. He will create a similar issue on the PSI-MS GitHub if there's no reaction on the email.

## ASMS workshop

Our proposal has been accepted for a workshop at ASMS. It is scheduled on Tuesday November 2, 5:45â€“7:00pm ET.

- Who will be at ASMS in person? Dave & Wout.
- Check our [abstract](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10-ZY-hiIZqlcKjsgyarlRUF2MN7GuTWJJlaV3MQjcMY/edit?usp=sharing) to see whether we want to submit changes before August 23.

[Workshop program](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1frOR9Z1BZE5ELzl0XznQsPqZWE0IzEEnK9hvsZ87Lds/edit?usp=sharing):

- Debate: What holds you back from using QA/QC? Dave will script the role of hesitant PI. Use the discussion to lead up to other topics.
- Short videos (~5 min) to demo QC software: Paul Brack (instrument dashboard)?, Chris Bielow (PTXQC)?, Dave Tabb (outlier detection and batch effects using the 120 MTb data), Mathias Walzer (mzQC).
    - Additional contributions about MALDI profiling or Panorama Public?
- Live demonstrations.
    - Discussion on different data quality aspects to check when your results are weird.
