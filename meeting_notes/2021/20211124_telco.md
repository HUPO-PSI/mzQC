## QC CV integration with MS CV

Currently two systems of specifying metric categorization are used: `is_a` and `relationship`.

- We will consistently use `is_a` to encode categories. This matches what the MS CV does.

Relevant metric categories are:

- Physical location.
- Retention time.
- Ion mobility.
- m/z.
- Intensity.
- Identification.
- Quantification.

We will merge the current open PRs and tackle small remaining tasks afterwards.

We will merge the QC CV into the MS CV piece by piece. Wout will address this during next week PSI-MS call.
