## MS and QC CV integration

Which prefix to use for the QC terms?

- Options: consistently "MS", keep "QC", alternatively "MSQC".
    - We will switch to the "MS" prefix as well.
- OBOFoundry prefers descriptive (longer) prefixes. They probably won't like use claiming the general "QC".
- Hierarchy in the CV will be indicated by accession numbers (QC terms with form `XX:4000XXX`) and by introducing a new top-level term from which the QC terms are then derived.

How to encode units and value types:

- The `xref` notation does not need to be used as it is not proper OBO.
- This is currently encoded using `property_value` in the QC CV.
- Use `relationship` specifications instead: `relationship: has_units` and `relationship: has_value_type`.

Miscellaneous:

- Double-check to avoid duplicate terms when merging (e.g. retention time).
- Make sure the "column" terms are explicitly denoted as such in their names.
- Prepare the changes in the mzQC repository first, then open a PR to transfer the CV to the [psi-ms-CV](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/psi-ms-CV/) repository.
