Tasks to finalize the specification document:

1. Decide whether to include a `userParameter` element or not. This was requested by the reviewers, and in our previous call we decided to include it with the caveat that it is strongly encouraged to request a proper CV term instead. Mathias has raised some objections. See the discussion in [issue 126](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/126).
2. Complete section 8 on syntactic and semantic validation. The specification document should only contain a brief snippet of text to refer to a document with validation rules on GitHub. Mathias will work on implementing semantic validation in mzqc-pylib when he has a bit more time.
3. Extend the examples on GitHub. (i) Make sure all links in the appendix are valid. (ii) Include examples to demonstrate the interplay between mzQC and mzML, mzTab, and SDRF.
