## PSI website

Our page on the [PSI website](https://psidev.info/groups/quality-control) needs to be updated:

- Mathias has added Wout as co-chair instead of secretary.
- We need to remove mentions of qcML and should bring the goals and milestones in line with our current plans.
- We can add an acknowledgments section with the names of people who have contributed in the past.

## Semantic validation

Semantic rules that were identified:

- Metrics MUST NOT be duplicated within a single `runQuality`/`setQuality` element.
- The `label` of `metadata` elements MUST by unique in an mzQC file.
- All columns in a table `qualityMetric` MUST have the same length.
- The `ID`, `name`, and `type` of `controlledVocabulary` elements MUST match the information specified in the QC-CV.

Other:

- Multiple root `mzQC` elements in a single mzQC file is invalid based on the JSON schema.
- The semantic rules must be implemented in the mzqc-pylib reference implementation. Can we create a sort of mapping file to facilitate this implementation?
- The semantic rules must be collected on GitHub.
