## QC and MS CV integration

- [#141](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/141): Tasks needed to address prior to merging with the PSI-MS CV.
- Review [PR145](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/pull/145) to finalize preparations for the merge with the PSI-MS CV.
    - **TODO** everyone: Carefully go through the CV and check for ambiguities. Provide feedback in the PR.
- Address related issues [#147](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/147), [#148](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/148), [#149](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/149), [#151](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/151), [#152](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/152), [#153](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/153), [#155](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/155).
- How to merge? Wout will ask in the PSI-MS meeting whether they prefer one big PR or whether to split it in smaller chunks for easier review.

[#120](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/120): Categorization of the CV terms.

- Current system:
    - `is_a`: What type of metric is this (single value, n-tuple, etc.)?
    - `is_a`: QC metric basis (ID-free, quant based, etc.; derived from `QC:4000008`). Only used for a few terms.
    - `relationship`: Scope; single or multiple runs.
- Keep improvements to the hierarchical structure in mind when reviewing the CV.
- Sketch out relevant categories in a new issue.
- Make sure that relationship definitions are consistent with existing relationships in the PSI-MS CV. For example, PSI-MS uses a `part_of` relationship.

### New CV terms

- [#158](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/158): Acquisition start and end time will be directly requested as child terms of the existing PSI-MS terms.
