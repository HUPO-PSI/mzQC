# ASMS workshop

We will propose to organize a workshop at ASMS 2021 in Philadelphia.

- Potential overlap? 1. There will not be a general PSI workshop. 2. The LC-MS interest group has not held a workshop last year and will likely not focus on QC without Michael Bereman.
- Format?
    - Debate on QC aspects.
    - Bring your own data. (Challenging for remote participants.)
    - Live QC analysis of public data.
    - Ideas for game show style?
    - User questionnaire to poll how we can contribute to the state of QC.
- Short video contributions by Chris (evaluate MaxQuant quality with PTXQC) and Mathias (mzqc-pylib).
- [Draft abstract](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10-ZY-hiIZqlcKjsgyarlRUF2MN7GuTWJJlaV3MQjcMY/edit?usp=sharing): Provide modifications on July 1, Wout will submit in the afternoon.
