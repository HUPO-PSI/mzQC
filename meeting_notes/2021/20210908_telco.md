## CV

What are some discrepancies that need to be addressed before the [QC CV can be merged with the MS CV](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/psi-ms-CV/issues/80)?

- How are value types defined? Single metrics / n-tuples / tables / matrix in the QC CV vs `xref: value-type` in the MS CV.
- Mathias has inquired with Silvie whether it would be possible to proceed to the public review while we are still finalizing the CV merger.
- Mathias will send around a Doodle to find a time to meet with the MS CV maintainers.

Address issues on GitHub to request CV terms:

- Some old issues have previously been cleaned up.
- [#133](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/133): Discussion on how to define single spectrum metrics and how to encode them in both mzQC (table) and mzML (`cvParam` of spectra) files. [PR #138](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/pull/138) will be updated accordingly.
- [#97](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/97): Review of the SwaMe metrics will remain pending. All of the information is in the issue, but we need to verify it is still up to date and reflects the [Yamato](https://github.com/PaulBrack/Yamato) implementation.
- [#76](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/76): Mathias will review these terms to see which ones are already in the CV or are no longer relevant.
