## mzQC implementations

Requirements for software to properly support mzQC are:

- All QC metrics are included in the CV.
- The software reads/writes mzQC files that adhere to the up-to-date specification.


### Core libraries

- **Python:** [mzqc-pylib](https://github.com/bigbio/mzqc-pylib) (Mathias Walzer)
    - Functionality: Data structures to work with mzQC metrics, (de-)serialization, validation.
    - Tested, [documented](https://mzqc-pylib.readthedocs.io/) (needs to be extended), containerized code.
    - **TODO:** Need to work on validation. Syntactical validation is done based on the JSON Schema, but more extensive semantic validation needs to be added.

Additional core libraries in different languages will be useful to facilitate mzQC adoption by other developers.

- **R:** Can we extract a basic R library from code written for PTXQC?
    - This doesn't necessarily need to be a fully featured library, mainly basic data structures and (de-)serialization functionality. The reference implementation can remain the mzqc-pylib.
    - @cbielow: How straightforward is it to extract this functionality from the [PTXQC codebase to represent mzQC classes](https://github.com/cbielow/PTXQC/blob/master/R/MzQC_classes.R)?
- **.NET:** Can we start from the Yamato code developed by @PaulBrack?
- **Java:** The [Jackson](https://www.baeldung.com/jackson) library can be used for JSON (de-)serialization. Do we need a Java library and do we have experienced Java developers?

We will need an online validator (based on the mzqc-pylib). This should be relatively straightforward after semantic validation has been added to mzqc-pylib. Initially the validator can be hosted on the EBI cloud infrastructure, in the longer term it will be moved to the official EBI cluster.
    
### Higher-level software

Tools:

- QuaMeter ID-free (Dave Tabb): Draft support for mzQC output but does not comply with some of the latest specification changes.
- [Yamato / SwaMe / Prognosticator](https://github.com/PaulBrack/Yamato) (Dave Tabb & Paul Brack): Draft support for mzQC output but does not comply with some of the latest specification changes. Not represented by the CV yet.
- [QC Calculator](https://github.com/bigbio/qccalculator) (Mathias Walzer): Reimplementation of 32 ID-free and 48 ID-based metrics. Some more code development will be necessary. Input: open formats (mzML), output: mzQC using mzqc-pylib.
- [OpenMS](https://github.com/OpenMS/OpenMS) (Axel Walter): Can export to qcML and mzQC. QC metrics need to be added from the CV. Special attention will be devoted to make sure that metabolomics is properly supported.
- [PTXQC](https://github.com/cbielow/PTXQC) (Chris Bielow): PTXQC contains R data structures mapping to mzQC. Export to JSON is currently still missing.

Scripts:

- Dave has R code to read and write quality metrics — not fully adapted to mzQC yet.
- Assurance software (target: technical note): Imports mzQC, but it does not conform to the final specification.

### External software

- [MatrixQCvis](https://github.com/tnaake/MatrixQCvis) (Thomas Naake; contact: Reza): New R/Shiny software for metabolomics quality control. Thomas indicated willingness to create example mzQC output.
