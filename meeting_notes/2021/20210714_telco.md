## mzQC validator

Mathias is working on setting up a server to host an mzQC file validator based on the mzqc-pylib.

Mathias has created a documentation landing page using GitHub pages: https://hupo-psi.github.io/mzQC/

- The landing page will link out to relevant pages on our GitHub for non-technical users who are not familiar with browsing GitHub directly.
- It will include the validator functionality. (TODO: Need to figure out whether this is possible on GH pages with JavaScript, or whether only static pages are possible. In the latter case, we'll simply link to an external validator web page.)

## Review

- The specification document has been made read-only.
- Open reviewer questions have been addressed. Wout and Mathias will go over the response to reviewers one more time before it will be submitted by the end of the week.
