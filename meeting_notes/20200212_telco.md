## Spring meeting

So far only three people from our working group have signed up for the Spring Meeting in San Diego next month: Dave, Wout, and Paul.

Please register if you haven't done so yet! More information is available [here](http://www.psidev.info/hupo-psi-meeting-2020).

To allow participation of people that can't travel to San Diego we'll set up remote sessions in the mornings on March 24-25.

## Example datasets & CV

- Several MSstatsQC examples are available [here](https://msstats.org/datasets/). We will select some of these examples and convert them to the mzQC format. To do so first the corresponding terms will need to be added to our CV.
- Reza will suggest some metabolomics datasets that we can use.
- Marina has requested some new CV terms corresponding to SwaMe. Julian has ported those to an open [Github issue](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues/97).

## Specification document

Some people provided comments on the [specification document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/132F3MBgDJgtFlXxDZhpJ1oHGbKL8pT6dk9fvL55L5_M/edit?usp=sharing). Mathias will assign tasks to people to keep working on the document.

## Miscellaneous

Our next teleconference will be on March 11.
