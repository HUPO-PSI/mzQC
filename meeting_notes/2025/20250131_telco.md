## CV term requests

- Feedback has been provided on all pending CV terms requested by Julian.
- Julian will convert requests into pull requests for finalization.
- Dave has been working on TDAuditor, a set of CV terms will be requested in the near future.

## QC for DIA

- SwaMe (Marina Pauw's PhD project) was close to completion but was never published.
- Dave's goal is to integrate SwaMe's metrics into the mzQC paper (DIAmetric).
- Marina has agreed to run her code on the dataset, pending debugging.

## Logging severity in mzQC Validator

- Current numeric severity scale (1-9) is too complex and arbitrary.
- Plan to simplify to standard logging levels: Error, Warning, and Info.
- Action item: **Mathias** to draft a revised severity classification.

## mzQC manuscript progress

- Tim has started rewriting the introduction.
- The outlier detection analysis is progressing, with different approaches showing varying results.
    - Some interpretation of ID-free vs. ID-based metrics is still required.
    - Action item: **Wout** to continue refining outlier analysis and add interpretation.
- Lipidomics data processing: Nils is still working on extracting metrics from the data.
- MS imaging: Need to check with Theodore Alexandrov on the feasibility of including MS imaging QC.
    - Action item: **Wout** to reach out to Theodore for input.
