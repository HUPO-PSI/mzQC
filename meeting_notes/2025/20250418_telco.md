## Discussion on controlled vocabulary (CV) and metrics

- The use of the same CV term for different contexts (e.g., MS1 vs. MS2 mass resolving power) can be misleading.
    - Consensus: Separate terms are justified if the interpretation differs (e.g., MS1 vs. MS2).
    - Clarification: While mzML files use a shared term for MS1 and MS2 resolving power, mzQC can add interpretive meaning and should differentiate.

## mzQC export in TDAuditor and DIAmetric

- Dave is now able to export mzQC files incorporating requested metrics using Mathias's export library.
- Discussion: TD-Auditor exports metrics for each scan (native ID, scan number, RT, etc.) in a vectorized format.
