## rmzqc performance update

- Chris provided a brief update on Slack: rmzqc is now significantly faster at reading large files.

## CV term requests

- The PR for DIAMetric terms has been submitted over a month ago to the PSI-MS CV GitHub repo.
    - **Action:** Wout will follow up with Eric Deutsch and Joshua Klein to get the PR reviewed and the terms merged.
- The McQuaC terms also await final accessioning and PR submission.

Discussion on TDAuditor metrics:

- Some clarifications surrounding the definition of metrics.
    - Spectrum-similarity is computed via pairwise comparisons between deconvolved MS/MS spectra.
    - Edges are drawn between scans with improbably high peak mass overlaps.
    - Clustering is an emergent property from this similarity graph; it is not a prerequisite for computing the metric.
    - Connected components: Identified via greedy traversal; edges are not pruned or thresholded beyond similarity probability.
- Wout reviewed several TD Auditor metrics:
    - Redundant metrics: the fraction of scans with peaks can be derived from complementary values. Redundant metric to be removed.
    - Unclear metrics: Clarification will be added in comments for those less familiar with top-down workflows.
    - Connected components and graph metrics: Descriptions to be clarified for interpretation and documentation.
- **Action:** Wout and Dave will coordinate updates and clarification comments on GitHub.

Discussion around appropriate categorization for activation method metrics (e.g., HCD, CID):

- Decision: Re-categorize these as "MS2 metrics" instead of general "MS metrics."
- **Action:** Wout to update metric categories and definitions accordingly.

## mzQC manuscript progress

Outlier detection use case:

- Implemented feature attribution to identify metrics (e.g., MS1 TIC change, MS1 density) responsible for outliers.
- Next steps: Wout to finalize text and figures for this section.

Lipidomics use case:

- Labeling inconsistencies in submitted metabolomics data raised questions.
- **Action:** Nils to follow up with Matthias and Bo to clarify sample types and labeling issues.

DIA use case:

- Dave provided a concise example metric: time to 50% TIC in each m/z window.
- Visual supports QC for large-scale DIA as supplementary info.

## ELIXIR BioHackathon planning

Hackathon logistics:

- Registration closed July 15. Awaiting participant list and topic preferences from ELIXIR.
- Projects are flexible; participants can move between groups.

Preparation plan:

- September: Define project scope, tasks, and preparatory material.
- Early October: Hold joint Zoom prep meeting with registered participants.
- Hackathon (November): Focus on hands-on development from day one.
