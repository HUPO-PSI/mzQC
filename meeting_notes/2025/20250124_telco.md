## CV term requests

- Julian has requested around 20 CV terms on GitHub.
- Wout has commented on all of them with feedback. Most are straightforward to integrate.
- One PR regarding changes from quartiles to quantiles has already been merged.

## Metabolomics batch correction website example

- There is a discrepancy between run-level and set-level metrics.
- Mismatched PCA results and quantification data points.
- Run metric uses count-based metrics, while the set-level metric uses MS1 feature areas.
- Action item: Metrics need to be updated for consistency, pending input from **Mathias** for further clarification.

## Use cases for mzQC manuscript

- Outlier detection: Wout has started implementing a subspace explanation algorithm based on previous work.
    - The method involves super-sampling outliers and using binary classification for feature importance extraction.
    - The initial hierarchical clustering results were not optimal, indicating possible implementation issues.
    Next steps: **Wout** to debug outlier explanation code and improve visualization methods for clearer insights.
- System suitability for longitudinal monitoring: Mostly finalized with MsStatsQC integration (MsStatsQC can now read mzQC).
    - The description in the manuscript needs some restructuring into results and methods sections.
- Targeted lipidomics: A bug was found in mzR's chromatogram implementation for mzML files. Nils has contacted Steffen Neumann and submitted a pull request to fix it.
    - Next steps involve working with Mathias to refine analysis.
- Potential use case on QC for DIA
    - A new paper with a large dataset (2700 DIA and 2600 DDA files) was discussed. They rated runs manually for over 2.5 years. [ref](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-54871-1)
