## Metabolomics batch processing example

- The metabolomics batch processing example (PR 233) is considered finalized, with the exception of the mzQC file, which does not pass validation using the official validator.
- The validator produces a cryptic error, indicating "no mzqc", suggesting either a malformed or incomplete file structure, a potential namespace or document format issue, or a problem with the validator's expectations (e.g., missing top-level mzQC object or improper file wrapping).
- This issue needs further investigation to determine whether the problem lies in the file format or in the validator behavior.

## CV term requests

- Several CV terms requested for DIAMetric, TDAuditor, and McQuaC.
- Julian will compile the latter and open a PR against the PSI-MS-CV repository.
- The former two still need to be evaluated and discussed.

## Manuscript use cases

- Limited progress to report, need to pick this up again!

## Miscellaneous

- Yasset is working with a student in China to develop a pmultiqc workflow to add QC reports to PRIDE datasets.
    - We will contribute to this effort as working group and should make sure that mzQC is natively supported.
- The mzQC proposal was not selected for the Google Summer of Code. Chris is looking into providing an OpenMS fellowship for the student to still be able to work on this over the summer.
