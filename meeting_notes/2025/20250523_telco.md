## Metabolomics batch processing example

- Issue: JSON mzQC file failed validation; error message: “no mzQC structure detectable.”
    - File passed basic JSON validation but failed the online mzQC validator.
    - Mathias and Wout suspect legacy formatting issues or serialization artifacts.
    - Proposed solution: Create a clean, simplified mzQC file from scratch with desired metrics and validate that version.

## rmzqc output for PCA outlier scores

- Discussion: Comparison of two formats for table metrics: row-based vs. column-based.
- Chris will adjust rmzqc to output a dataframe, conforming to correct mzQC spec.
- Descriptions within metrics should extract proper quoted strings; current validator flags issues when the full line is used.

## CV term harmonization for outlier scores

- Discussion: Dave's PCA-based and Wout's probability-based outlier scores are distinct and require separate CV terms.
    - Existing issue filed to track this on GitHub.
- Decision: Two separate metrics will be created with appropriate CV terms.

## CV term requests

- McQuaC: Julian submitted initial CV term proposals to the PSI-MS-CV repository.
    - Feedback from Eric: avoid prepositions, follow naming convention of specific-to-general.
- DIAMetric: Several new metrics proposed.
    - Some overlap with existing metrics (e.g., TIC quartiles).
    - Other DIA-specific metrics will need new terms. Several proposed metrics were discussed and can be converted into CV terms.
- TDAuditor: Prioritize so that Dave can get his manuscript out.

## Manuscript use cases

General: We'll need to create a public GitHub repository related to the manuscript (under msQualityHub) to share the use case code scripts.

Outlier detection use case:
- Some discussion about harmonization of Wout's Python code and Dave's R code in a single workflow.

Lipidomics use case:
- Mathias, Nils, and Bo had a meeting to discuss dataset selection and QC metric reporting for the use case.

DIAMetric use case:
- Dave will prepare some paragraphs and think about figures to add this to the manuscript.
- DIAMetric CV terms will be prioritized for inclusion in the CV due to dependency on manuscript timeline.
