## JSON Schema Updates

Label field requirement change:

- The `label` field in the schema was switched from optional to required.
- We still need to correct example files that currently lack this field.

URI field correction for software tools:

- The `uri` field was mistakenly required in the JSON schema; it should be optional per the specification.
- This has been corrected and the PR is ready for merge.

Link check failures in GitHub PRs:

- The current link-checking setup flags broken links in the docs, causing PR check failures.
- Action: **Mathias** will fix these broken links as part of an existing PR related to HTML validator updates.

## Validator Enhancements

HTML Validator Updates:

- Significant restructuring completed, including:
    - Migration to a severity level system (info/warning/error).
    - Improved post-validation cleanup and more concise test coverage.
- HTML validator auto-doc generation is integrated using a template-based system tied to the API.

Error description refinement:

- Action: **Wout** to review and provide feedback on validator error wording, referencing Slack discussion for context.

Pending release:

- Validator updates will be included in the next release, triggering container builds for the online validator.
- Timeline: ~1 week until release.

## pymzqc and rmzqc Fixes

- Minor bug fixes made to both pymzqc and rmzqc.
- Validator updates are directly linked to these fixes, qualifying the next release as a bug fix release.
- rmzqc had a recent update as well, though the ontology parsing issue remains:
    - Chris is waiting on a dependency update.
    - Action: If no progress is made, Chris will assign the ontology parsing task to an incoming intern.

## CV Requests and QC Metrics

Pending CV metrics:

- DIAMetric and McQuaC metric requests submitted to PSI-MS CV but not yet merged.
- TDAuditor metrics pending review.

## Manuscript Use Cases

Outlier Detection

- Two runs identified as outliers due to:
    - High scores in MS1 TIC change quartile ratio and MS1 density quantiles.
    - Indicative of spray instability (observable as TIC drop).
- Action: **Wout** will:
    - Add visual TIC plots as supplementary figures.
    - Create a diagram illustrating tool interoperability (QuaMeter, PTXQC, etc.).
    - Update manuscript text with interpretations and figures.

Lipidomics

- Dataset: >200 runs, multiple QC types (plasma, RQC, BQC, LTRS, etc.).
- Setup:
    - Notebook structured for reproducible analysis via Colab.
    - Data includes SRM mode chromatograms (stored in chromatogram section, no spectra).
- Metrics Under Development:
    - Coefficient of Variation (CV): Calculated per metabolite/lipid species.
    - Response Linearity: Needs missing RQC1 block for full assessment.
        - Action: **Mathias** contacted Nils to retrieve RQC1 data.
    - Long-Term Response Stability: Compared CVs of LTRS-A vs. LTRS-B. Values near zero suggest instrument stability.
        - Discussion on whether difference or ratio of CVs is more appropriate.
    - TQC vs. BQC CV Ratio: 43% of ratios <1, suggesting better response in BQC for some species.
        - Mathias seeks input from Nils to better interpret lipid-specific results.
    - Signal-to-Blank Ratio: Compared blanks vs. real samples using TIC overlays.
        - Issues with chromatogram visualization and interpretation noted.
- Tool Reference: Bo's in-house QC tool serves as a benchmark. Its metrics exceed current scope but inspire potential enhancements.
- Manuscript Framing:
    - Use case will highlight best practices in lipidomics QC using mzQC.
    - Action: Await further input from Nils and potentially Bo to refine metrics and narrative.

## BioHackathon Planning

Funding and Reimbursement:

- Emails received by Wout and Julian, but not Chris.
- Two organizers' accommodations and meals are fully covered; travel reimbursed up to â‚¬400.
- Action: Check with **Julian** whether he has received additional Reimbursement information.

Planning:

- No urgent hackathon-related decisions at this point.
- Scope definition and preparatory work to begin in coming weeks.
