## Repository Maintenance and Validation

- Broken link check in GitHub actions
    - Issue persists with two 404 URLs linked in the guide map of the mzQC website.
    - **Action:** Mathias will fix these links and push a commit to the existing PR (#314).
    - Once updated, Wout confirmed the PR is good to merge.
- Semantic validation error hierarchy
    - Proposal to replace verbose severity reporting with a simplified severity: message format (error/warning/info).
    - Earlier discussion on Slack (now expired due to 90-day history limit) contained feedback from Chris that Wout supported.
    - **Action:** Mathias to review GitHub issue (pymzQC #60) and integrate agreed changes; open points will be discussed at the next meeting.
    - Consensus: Important discussions should be mirrored on GitHub to avoid Slack history loss.

## Controlled Vocabulary (CV) Terms

- CV term requests for metrics in McQuac:
    - Final minor edits by Julian completed.
    - All checks passed, pending merge by Joshua (agreed in last week's call).
- TD Auditor metrics:
    - ~12 items still require GitHub review.
    - Wout has not yet reviewed them this week.

## Manuscript Progress

Lipidomics use case:

- Nils' status: unable to attend; will coordinate with Mathias next week.
- Data completeness issues: Missing Skyline file and half of dilution series QC runs are blockers for some analyses.
- Draft structure (Mathias' updates):
    - General sections: settings, introduction, data introduction, case orientation.
    - Orientation paragraphs clarify QC goals for each use case.
    - Initial draft is verbose (~200 words per section); Mathias aims to condense or shift details to Methods.
- Metrics and analyses under consideration:
    - Calibration curve QC runs – linear response and filtering documentation in mzQC.
    - Limit of Detection (LOD) calculations based on ICH Q2 guidelines.
        - **Action:** Mathias will prepare a structured presentation for the next call.
    - Normalization and drift correction: discussion with Niels pending.
    - Effect size metrics (Cohen's D, SD ratios) to measure normalization impact.
        - Team cautious about overwhelming readers but agreed inclusion in supplementary materials could be useful.
    - Structural description of mzQC sets for complex experimental designs (lipidomics) proposed.
- Software/tool integration:
    - Use of Midar (R package) for QC metrics extraction identified as beneficial.
    - Plan: export metrics from Midar into mzQC for manuscript use cases.

## New Use Case: Repository-Scale Metabolomics QC

- Data overview (presented by Fatemeh):
    - Dataset: ~800,000 runs × 20 columns (17 numeric QC metrics).
    - Data completeness: ~83%.
    - Acquisition modes: 84% centroid only, 10% profile only, 1% both, 4% neither.
    - MS2 present in ~60% of runs; MS3 rare (0.2%).
    - Missing values: MS2 isolation width missing for 96% of rows; precursor m/z missing for 67%.
    - Anomalies include negative acquisition ranges.
- Interpretation and strategy:
    - Data shows huge variability across studies → strong case for standardized QC reporting.
    - Coefficients of variation >20% across most metrics.
    - Potential analysis paths:
        - Clustering runs by QC metrics to reveal usage patterns (MS1-only vs. MS/MS, positive vs. negative mode).
        - Aggregation at the study level (as suggested by Chris) to reduce noise and highlight lab-level variability.
        - Possible enrichment by linking instrument metadata from external sources (e.g., ReDU).
    - **Action:** Wout and Fatemeh to generate preliminary clustering results for further development as a manuscript use case.

## Biohackathon Planning

- Wout will draft a background and task description document for participants based on last week's discussion.
- Invitations to join the Biohackathon Slack have been received by organizers (Wout, Julian, Chris).
- Need to plan a kickoff meeting before the hackathon. Timing considerations:
    - Next scheduled call (Oct 3) falls on a German public holiday.
    - Suggestion: move meeting earlier (next week) or in three weeks depending on availability.
    - Wout will be in China during the three-week slot but can attend in the evening.
    - **Action:** Julian to check with Elixir on participant interest; group to finalize kickoff date on Slack after Wout shares draft.
