## Repository-Scale QC and Biohackathon Planning

- Upcoming Elixir Biohackathon (November 2025).
- Main goal: repository-scale QC. Proposal submitted by Julian, Wout, and Chris.
- Yasset has been developing pMultiQC, extending QC efforts from QuantMS workflows to PRIDE data. Aim to synergize with hackathon activities.

**pMultiQC Overview (Yasset)**

- Built on MultiQC (genomics), extended for proteomics:
    - Supports LFQ, TMT, DIA workflows.
    - Initially developed in QuantMS; extended to MaxQuant and DIA-NN.
    - Integration with PX/PRIDE Inspector metrics (e.g., peptide/protein distributions, miscleavage rates).
    - Adapters for different search engines (Andromeda, Comet, MSFragger, etc.).
- Architecture:
    - Modular plugins per tool/workflow.
    - Support for ProteoBench benchmark outputs.
    - Available via PyPI, Bioconda, Biocontainers.
    - Open source; contributions welcome.
- Deployment:
    - Services can be run locally (lab deployment with Docker/Kubernetes) or public-facing (PRIDE integration).
    - Example workflows allow processing PRIDE datasets directly via accession numbers.
    - Redis integration supports scaling.
    - Current cleanup: uploaded/private data removed every 5 hours.
- Current limitations:
    - Output only HTML (user-facing); no mzQC export yet.
    - Run-oriented QC; limited sample-level aggregation due to missing/partial SDRF support in tools.

**Discussion Points**

- Caching:
    - Chris suggested caching QC results to avoid recomputation.
    - Yasset: current library is fast; caching unnecessary unless dataset size grows. Private data handling complicates caching.
    - Wout: caching would also enable querying QC results for dataset reuse discovery.
    - Consensus: mzQC export is prerequisite for meaningful caching/database integration.
- Next Development Steps:
    - mzQC export (machine-readable QC, not just HTML).
    - Adapters for additional tools (e.g., FragPipe, more DIA engines).
    - New metric definitions (tiered presentation: simple user-facing vs detailed expert diagnostics).
    - Tighter SDRF integration for sample-centric QC.
- Tiered Metrics Strategy:
    - Dave: emphasized importance of simple identification-based ratios (productivity, efficiency) for broad comprehension.
    - Yasset: QC metrics must be digestible for biologists (executive-level summaries).
    - Wout/Mathias: support two-tier system:
        - High-level, easy-to-interpret metrics for non-specialists.
        - Detailed diagnostic plots and metrics for core facilities and expert users.
    - Chris: metrics are not independent; proposed weighted aggregation into a single QC score per sample/experiment (lab/instrument dependent).
- Hackathon Planning:
    - Tasks identified:
        1. Implement mzQC export.
        2. Define/review QC metrics (with tiering).
        3. Build adapters for more workflows/search engines.
        4. Strengthen SDRF integration.
        5. Explore ID-free QC modules (Julian: workflows for direct QC on raw data, without identifications/quantification).
    - Resources needed:
        - Example datasets (esp. SDRF-annotated).
        - Open source pMultiQC code (for PR contributions).
    - Plan: circulate introductory material (overview of pMultiQC, project ideas, datasets) 2–3 weeks before hackathon.
    - Coordination with other hackathon topics:
        - Nils involved in related MS file interoperability project (mzTab/MZTab-M/metadata).
        - Overlap with QC work: SDRF and mzQC integration.
        - Expect cross-participation between hackathon sessions.
    - TODO @Wout: prepare shared hackathon prep document (overview, project list, resources) in next 2–3 weeks.

## Manuscript Updates and Use Cases

- mzQC Manuscript:
    - Still pending; group aims to finalize before hackathon if possible.
    - Lipidomics use case (Mathias/Nils): currently underdeveloped, some data provenance unclear.
        - Wout: even a "positive story" (showing well-designed QC experiment with expected metrics) is valuable.
        - Action: Mathias will draft the lipidomics use case text and circulate via Slack for group feedback.
- TDAuditor:
    - Dave: next priority is publishing TDAuditor metrics.
    - Aim: submission within 2 months.
    - Action: QC group to review and merge TDAuditor metrics into CV.
