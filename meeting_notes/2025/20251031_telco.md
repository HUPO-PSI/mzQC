## ELIXIR BioHackathon

Repository status & kickoff plan:

- The hackathon repository has been created with initial instructions.
- Chris performed an additional minor edit earlier in the week.
- The team considers the repo sufficient to start on Monday/Tuesday, with the understanding that documentation will be extended as issues surface during the event.
- Action: Wout to monitor early issues and expand documentation as needed during the first two days.
- Wout proposes a short daily stand-up at 09:00 for quick sync ("yesterday/today blockers") to improve visibility, avoid duplicated effort, and help people cluster around tasks of interest.
- Slides for the introduction session are complete with content for the group's topic.

Logistics for remote participation

- ELIXIR will provide a single Zoom entry point with breakout rooms for hackathon topics; the team will not host separate calls.
- A laptop must join the main link for remote participants when needed.
- Action: Any on-site lead (Wout/Chris/Julian) to ensure one laptop is connected to the shared Zoom link for the group's breakout.

Participants:

- Expected participants are uncertain; recruitment will rely on the Monday plenary introductions and Slack announcements.
- Known/likely remote: Timo (on/off availability).
- Potential interest from Dave.
- Some new names appeared in the Slack channel.
- Registration for online participation is believed to be free (registration still required).

Task planning: ID-free QC (DIA & DDA)

- Chris discussed Dave's DIAMetric tool (C#; publication in progress; repository under Dave's account).
    - It performs ID-free quality control for DIA data.
    - A Windows executable is included; repository cleanliness is mixed (Visual Studio files, EXEs, ZIPs).
- Proposed approaches for the hackathon:
    - Treat DIAMetric as a black-box baseline: download, compile or use the EXE, build a small workflow, and run on test data to establish a DIA ID-free QC baseline.
    - Re-implement the metric set in Python (e.g., with PyOpenMS) to increase accessibility and cross-platform usability, given limited C# familiarity in the community.
- Complementary coverage for DDA ID-free QC could leverage QuaMeter.
    - Pairing DIAMetric (DIA) with a DDA ID-free tool would cover a broad range of LCâ€“MS/MS experiments with core metrics.
    - Action: Evaluate available DDA ID-free QC tools (e.g., QuaMeter) and define a minimal set of comparable metrics to align with the DIA baseline.

## Manuscript: status & immediate needs

- The mzQC manuscript remains a priority; main gap is the lipidomics use case.
    - Nils and Mathias are expected to contribute but were absent.
- The metabolomics use case also needs conversion of current results into a solid section.
- Action: Wout to coordinate next week with Nils and Mathias for lipidomics material; Wout + team to refine the metabolomics section.
- Action: Wout/Chris/Julian to block dedicated manuscript slots during the week and capture progress.
