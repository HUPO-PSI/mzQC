## ELIXIR BioHackathon Updates and Logistics

- Julian reported from the recent Elixir BioHackathon info session:
    - The Slack workspace is now active, and the mzQC hackathon has its own channel.
    - Participants who expressed interest are not formally assigned; actual participation will be decided on-site Monday.
    - No list or count of interested participants has been released.
    - Pre-hackathon online meetings are discouraged to keep collaboration spontaneous and dynamic during the event.
- Consensus: No virtual pre-meeting will be organized due to participant uncertainty and the organizers' emphasis on on-site coordination.
- Attendees discussed informal strategies to attract participants (e.g., distributing candy bars or energy drinks at the session start).

## Hackathon Structure and Participant Engagement

- Hackathon organizers expect flexible movement between sessions.
    - Challenge: managing contributors who may join or leave midway.
    - Solution: define granular, self-contained tasks achievable within 1–2 days.
- Key requirements for day one:
    - A clear introduction and readable onboarding materials.
    - Concise guidance for setup and contribution pathways to minimize ramp-up time.
- **Action (Chris, Wout, Julian):** Finalize and polish the participant introduction document ensuring comprehensive instructions and background for late joiners.

## Hackathon Task Framework and Objectives

Existing task list (from internal document):

1. mzQC export in pMultiQC
    - Integration of mzQC as an output format.
    - Wout noted pMultiQC's ongoing refactoring to simplify backend integration.
    - Goal: make mzQC the medium for QC communication across tools (not "first-class output").
2. QC Metric Definition and Tier System
    - Define "core" universal QC metrics and "extended" metrics specific to workflows.
    - Task involves metric selection, ontology mapping, and implementation.
3. Adapters for Workflows and Search Engines
    - Extend QC metric collection to multiple search engines and workflows.
    - Dave proposed prioritizing MaxQuant as a high-impact starting point for integration into pMultiQC.
    - Broad coverage of all engines is unrealistic; focus on modular, extensible examples.
4. SDRF Integration
    - Use experimental design metadata (SDRF) to drive QC computation.
    - Identify gold-standard datasets (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis outlier set) with full SDRF annotation.
    - **Action (Dave):** Generate SDRFs for legacy datasets used in mzQC demonstrations.
5. ID-Free QC Metrics
    - Implement QC metrics independent of identification data.
    - Aim to develop lightweight workflows applicable across PRIDE datasets.

Proposed additional/combined tasks:

- Automated Lightweight QC Workflow:
    - (Julian, Mathias) Create a minimal workflow executable on any PRIDE dataset by simply providing a PXD accession.
    - The pipeline should be quant- and ID-free, computing base-level QC such as spectrum counts or conversion success.
    - Links to Task 5 (ID-free metrics) and Task 4 (metadata integration).
- Documentation Expansion:
    - Each task should have a dedicated instruction page including:
    - Relevant repositories and code locations.
    - Guidance for making pull requests.
    - Controlled vocabulary (CV) terms used.
    - Implementation entry points (e.g., where pMultiQC handles output generation).
- **Action (Wout, Chris):** Create one technical document per task with this detailed onboarding information.

## Workflow Design and Completion Strategy

- Focus on tasks that can produce fully functional outcomes by week's end, avoiding partially finished prototypes.
- Modularity emphasized—contributors can work independently on discrete subtasks.
- Dave and Wout agreed that smaller, tractable goals would keep participants motivated and deliver measurable progress.
- **Action (Wout):** Rephrase hackathon documentation to ensure projects have limited, clearly defined deliverables.

## Participant Engagement and Reflection Session

- Proposal (Mathias): Introduce a structured reflection or feedback session mid- or end-week.
    - Objective: Encourage participants to critically assess mzQC and propose future development directions.
    - Format: Small group discussions synthesizing lessons, challenges, and feature suggestions.
- Wout supported the idea as a community-building mechanism and an opportunity for creative input.
- **Action (Mathias):** Draft a short proposal for this "Community Vision" session to circulate before the event.

## Collaboration and Dataset Coordination

- Collaboration with Nils' session:
    - To be clarified once Nils returns; potential synergies between their hackathon streams.
    - **Action (Wout):** Follow up with Nils to specify overlap and define cross-session activities.
- Discussion on SDRF authoring:
    - Creating SDRFs manually is burdensome; tools are under development (e.g., from Tine’s and Fatemeh’s work) for auto-generating SDRFs from manuscripts.

## Logistical Details

- Schedule:
    - Team will link directly to the official BioHackathon schedule (which includes hacking slots, breaks, and group photo).
    - No need for a parallel mzQC-specific timetable.
- Arrival Times:
    - Wout arriving ~18:00 Monday (after teaching).
    - Julian, Fatemeh, and Chris arriving ~12:00.
    - Chris may drive and coordinate airport pickup if parking logistics allow.
- Kick-off Session:
    - One-slide project summary due early in the week (template provided by organizers).
    - **Action (Julian & Chris):** Prepare slide with leads, objectives, required skills, and contact info.
- Task Management Sheet:
    - Google Sheets tracker created by Chris to coordinate task assignments and avoid overlap.
    - Will be introduced during Monday's kickoff; includes columns for project leads, dependencies, and contact points.
    - **Action (Chris):** Add several simple "starter tasks" to help participants engage immediately.

## mzQC Manuscript Discussion

- Dave asked for an update on the mzQC manuscript.
    - Current blocker: Lipidomics use case incomplete.
    - Update (Mathias):
        - Contacted the original data authors (Bo's group) to obtain missing files (e.g., Skyline project).
        - Plan to embed mzQC metric output directly in their existing QC pipeline once files are retrieved.
- **Action (Mathias):** Finalize lipidomics QC integration once data arrive and circulate draft results for manuscript inclusion.
