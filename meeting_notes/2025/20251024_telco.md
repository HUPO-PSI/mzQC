## ELIXIR BioHackathon

GitHub Repository for Biohackathon Coordination

- Wout began converting the previously shared organization document into a [GitHub repository under the MS-Quality-Hub organization](https://github.com/MS-Quality-Hub/biohackathon2025). This aims to centralize resources and task coordination.
- The repository includes:
    - A landing page with a general introduction.
    - A resources page detailing background materials on mzQC, pMultiQC, and SDRF.
    - Individual task pages, including:
        - Task objectives.
        - Implementation steps.
        - Checklists for deliverables.
- Wout is extending content for additional tasks and will circulate these for review.
- **Action:** Wout to finish converting tasks 3â€“5 and request feedback from group members.

Task Review and Collaboration Plan

- Wout asked participants to:
    - Review task descriptions for completeness and clarity.
    - Add missing details, especially regarding metrics and tool-specific integration (e.g., pMultiQC).
    - Yasset to be consulted for verifying pMultiQC documentation.
- GitHub issues and pull requests will be used to track task progress.
- Nils maintains a central Google Doc linking his file interoperability projects.
- **Action:** Nils to share Google Doc link via Slack; Wout to link it from the GitHub repo.

Repository Integration and Forking Strategy

- Chris suggested forking the pMultiQC repo into the MS-Quality-Hub namespace:
    - Allows development of partial or in-progress features without affecting the upstream.
    - Later changes can be reviewed and merged upstream when stable.
    - Yasset's input is needed to finalize the contribution workflow.
    - **Action:** Chris to discuss with Yasset and confirm preferred PR management approach.
- There may be recent architectural changes in pMultiQC due to a partial rewrite, including new plotting frameworks and code translations from R to Python.
- **Action:** People to familiarize themselves with the latest version of pMultiQC before the hackathon.

Biohackathon Logistics

- Julian and Chris will prepare a single kickoff slide for Monday afternoon.
- **Action:** Julian and Chris to meet next week to finalize this.
- Wout will arrive Monday evening and be ready for coding tasks starting Tuesday morning.
- Nils clarified there will be one large shared room with flexible seating to promote cross-project interaction.
- Chris is checking hotel logistics but hasn't confirmed driving availability.

## Controlled Vocabulary (CV) Update Discussion

- Wout and Dave discussed several pending CV term proposals and clarifications:
    - Shift in data type from Quameter to TDAuditor changes some metric definitions (e.g., charge state reporting now includes min, max, median, quartiles instead of histogram counts).
    - Some terms are now clearly associated with top-down proteomics, requiring clarification to avoid confusion with bottom-up metrics.
    - **Action:** Dave to add top-down context to relevant definitions (e.g., TDAuditor metrics) either via comments or categorization.
- Agreement that CV should better express data origin: spectrum/run/multi-run, workflow step (LC, ionization, MS), ID-based vs. ID-free, and now potentially top-down vs bottom-up.
- **Action:** Wout to explore expanding CV categories to accommodate such contexts.
- CV issues (#292 and #320) discussed as examples of tagging metrics with de novo search or isolation window context.

## Manuscript Progress and Use Case Updates

- Dave hopes to finalize pull requests for TDAuditor and Diametric and publish both manuscripts by year's end.
- **Action:** Dave to respond to Wout's questions on GitHub and refine CV term definitions accordingly.

Lipidomics Use Case

- Nils recovered original Skyline files and identified missing dilution series samples.
    - These will be re-exported for complete peak area data and used to generate QC metrics.
    - **Action:** Nils to contact Mathias, update the shared Google Doc, and push forward with metric extraction.

Metabolomics Repository Use Case

- Fatemeh analyzed data from GNPS (via Yasin):
    - A heatmap of ~10,000 random runs from a dataset of ~800,000 was generated.
    - Four high-level QC metrics (number of MS1/MS2 scans in positive/negative mode) revealed broad experimental clustering.
    - This simple classification illustrates repository-wide metadata utility.
    - **Action:** Fatemeh to convert this analysis into one or two paragraphs for the manuscript.
