## Manuscript Progress and Contributor Status

- The manuscript is in progress, with partial contributions from team members; Wout did some editing and writing during the last week.
- The lipidomics use case remains incomplete, and follow-up is needed with Nils and Matthias to finalize this section.
- Wout highlighted the need for another non-proteomics use case (e.g., GNPS/metabolomics) to better represent the broad applicability of mzQC and avoid proteomics-centric bias.

## BioHackathon Planning (pmultiqc and mzQC Integration)

- Main Focus: Integration of pmultiqc (from Yasset) with mzQC concepts for QC metric standardization.
- Yasset is leading development on pmultiqc, a more platform-agnostic tool than PTXQC. He aims to submit a community-led manuscript in ~4 weeks and welcomes contributions.
- pmultiqc defines a fixed set of QC metrics. During the BioHackathon, the plan is to:
    - Familiarize participants with the codebase.
    - Assign individual metrics to contributors.
    - Have 1â€“2 people implement general framework support.
    - Develop and integrate specific QC metrics into pmultiqc.
- Action: Chris will reach out to Yasset to request participation in the next meeting (tentatively August 22) or suggest an alternative time.
- Consider synergies with related topics at the BioHackathon (e.g., mzTab-M from Nils).

## QC Terms and Controlled Vocabulary (mzQC)

Wout provided an update on QC terms:
- Recent batch of QC terms (e.g., for DIAMetric and outlier detection metrics) were approved by Joshua after correction of copy-paste issues.
- Another batch (McQuaC terms from Julian) is ready but awaits formal PR submission.
- TD-Auditor metrics (top-down QC) are partially reviewed; about a dozen new terms still need vetting.
