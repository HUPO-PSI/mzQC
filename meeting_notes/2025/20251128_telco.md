## Recap of the ELIXIR Biohackathon

- Several members (Wout, Chris, Julian, Fatemeh, Karin) worked intensively on the mzQC project, while Nils and others contributed to mzTab-M.
- QC metric literature review:
    - Fatemehand Karin compiled and curated QC metrics from recent and historical publications relevant to mass spectrometry QC workflows.
- pMultiQC integration:
    - Julian and Chris implemented preliminary mzQC export functionality in pMultiQC.
    - **Action: Wout** will review the pMultiQC pull request prepared by Julian and Chris before submission upstream.
- Metric categorization framework:
    - Wout developed a new multilevel categorization system for QC metrics (seven dimensions; see below).
- ID-free metrics:
    - Timo implemented 100+ identification-free QC metrics, intended for near-term inclusion in pMultiQC.
- General consensus: The hackathon provided concentrated progress across documentation, implementation, and conceptual development.

## QC Metric Categorization System: New Framework and Review Plan

**Overview of the Proposed Categorization**

The new system defines seven dimensions for every QC metric:

1. Analytical dimension (primary category; encoded directly as a CV subtype).
2. Workflow stage (where in the MS pipeline the metric applies).
3. Information dependency (ID-free, ID-based, raw spectral data, ion mobility, etc.).
4. Measurement scope (spectrum-level, run-level, multi-run aggregation, etc.).
5. Acquisition strategy (DDA, DIA, targeted, method-independent, etc.).
6. Interpretation direction (higher-is-better, lower-is-better, bounded-range).
7. Value type (scalar, tuple, vector, matrix).

- The documentation includes examples, subclass definitions, and CV encoding patterns.
- Metrics will declare one primary CV term plus 6 additional relationship-based annotations reflecting these dimensions.

**Requirement Discussion: Are all dimensions mandatory? Can a dimension have multiple values?**

- Initial proposal: require exactly one value per dimension.
- Dave Tabb and others raised concerns:
    - Many metrics intrinsically span multiple analytical dimensions (e.g., DIA window TIC midpoint metrics combining chromatography, gas-phase behavior, and intensity domains).
    - Some metrics (e.g., spectral library ion mobility deviation standard deviation) span ion mobility and identification confidence domains.
- Consensus:
    - Each dimension should require at least one value, but multiple values must be allowed when scientifically justified.
    - The categorization system should not force artificial monocategorization.

**Validation Against Existing Metrics**

- **Action: Fatemeh** will prepare a shared spreadsheet listing all QC metrics in the PSI-MS CV namespace (starting at MS:4000).
    - Columns: the seven categorization dimensions.
    - Rows: each existing MS:4000+ metric.
- **Action:** All participants will self-assign a handful of metrics, populate the seven fields, and identify missing subclasses or inconsistencies.
- Goal: Review findings at the next call (in two weeks).

## Application to TD-Auditor Metrics and Additional CV Term Proposals

- Wout processed ~30 TD-Auditor metrics, adding definitions and applying the new seven-dimensional categorization.
- Some additional DIA-related metrics (three) were also tentatively categorized, with new proposed CV terms for two; one requires clarifying input from Dave.
- **Action: Dave** will carefully review all TD-Auditor metric definitions and categorizations, as he is currently focused on TD-Auditor development.

## Engagement with the PSI-MS Working Group (PSI-MS CV)

- Wout discussed the categorization proposal with the PSI-MS working group, including back-and-forth via GitHub and teleconference.
- Outcome:
    - PSI-MS accepts the approach and does not object to introducing the new categories and relationships into the CV.
    - After finalizing the system, existing metrics and CV terms will need updates to include categorizations.
    - No urgency, but should be planned for the near future.

## QC Tooling Overview and Integration into Documentation

- Fatemeh compiled a broad list of QC tools from the literature.
- Chris suggested presenting this as a dense tabular summary, suitable for the mzQC documentation site.
- Columns may include acquisition strategy usage (DDA, DIA, targeted), data type (proteomics vs metabolomics), ID dependence, etc., but the team noted that exposing only a subset of dimensions may introduce bias.
- The mzQC compatibility column will be included to track integration progress (red → green).
- This overview will complement the metric categorization documentation.

## Manuscript Status: mzQC Main Paper

- The manuscript remains highest priority for completion before year's end.
- Repository-scale metabolomics use case:
    - **Action: Wout** will write 2–3 paragraphs describing this use case (includes data from repository-scale metabolomics studies and QC summarization).
- Lipidomics targeted use case:
    - Nils loaded original data into Skyline, exported raw peak areas and metadata, but some chromatographic/peak-picking inconsistencies remain.
    - **Action: Nils** will meet with Mathias to determine whether missing information results from Skyline peak detection or export limitations.
    - Nils will work on this after the Biohackathon Germany and commit time through December.
    - Much material already exists; main task is consolidation and gap-filling.
- Additional metabolomics use case:
    - Steffen Neumann expressed interest in applying mzQC in his lab's routine QC workflows (instrument maintenance QC).
    - This dataset would be orthogonal to existing ones and valuable for metabolomics coverage.
    - Not required for manuscript submission, but may be included if integration is efficient.
    - Steffen is expected to join the next meeting.

**Manuscript Timeline:**

- Goal: Complete a full draft (even if rough) before year-end.
- December recognized as a truncated work month; team will push to finalize the use cases before the holiday break.
- Manuscript polishing with co-authors planned for January.

## pymzQC and mzQC Validator Update

- Mathias released a new version of the pymzQC validator, now:
    - Available via PyPI and online validator service.
    - Includes semantic validation levels, color-coded output, and visualization improvements.
- Example error classes demonstrated: missing units, undefined units, missing CV terms.
- Metrics using non-QC CV terms (e.g., mass resolving power from mzML) will trigger informational notes rather than errors.
- Action: Users should test with their own mzQC files and report issues on the PyMzQC repository (not the main mzQC repo).

## Branding: MS Quality Hub Logo

- Wout prototyped a logo (created via AI prompting + manual vector editing).
- Logo concept: "QC" integrated with a magnifying glass handle inspecting peaks.
- A light and dark background version are available.
- This logo will be used for the MS Quality Hub, not specifically for mzQC (PSI-MS GitHub org constraints).
- Future consideration: a dedicated mzQC logo.
