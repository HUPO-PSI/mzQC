We have a couple of tutorials and guides to offer, this page will lead you to them:

### with python
* read mzQC: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/MS-Quality-hub/pymzqc/blob/v1.0.0rc2/jupyter/colab/read_in_5_minutes.ipynb)
* write mzQC: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/MS-Quality-hub/pymzqc/blob/v1.0.0rc2/jupyter/colab/write_in_5_minutes.ipynb)

## JSON
If you are new to JSON or file formats (with JSON), 
the next few links should provide you with an overview:

- [JSON (by W3C)](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp)
- [JSON (by mozilla)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON)
- [File format schemas with JSON](https://json-schema.org/learn/getting-started-step-by-step.html)
- JSON crash course (by freecodecamp)

## Ontologies
Ontologies also known as controlled vocabularies are used in mzQC to manage metric definitions and metric value content. 
Here is a list of links and documents that should help you out in case you want to know more.
* Ontologies are powerful tools, we mostly use them as [controlled vocabularies](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Controlled_vocabulary&oldid=1092198296)
* The W3C has a bit broader explanation of [ontologies](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/ontology)
* Visit the [HUPO-PSI webpage](https://www.psidev.info/groups/controlled-vocabularies) for more information on CV use in different settings.
* __Browse our controlled vocabulary terms on [OLS](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/ms/classes/http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FMS_4000000?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FMS_4000000&lang=en&viewMode=All&siblings=false)__
* If you want to start with the foundations and get ambitious here are the resources [from protege for ontology development](https://protege.stanford.edu/publications/ontology_development/ontology101.pdf)
* Luckily, we have all the relevant metrics and terms in [PSI-MS CV](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/psi-ms-CV) (<sub>so no [Ontology Dowsing](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Ontology_Dowsing) necessary</sub>)
