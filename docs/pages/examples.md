These introductory use cases provide examples of how mzQC files are structured and can be used:

- [Representing QC data for an individual mass spectrometry run](intro_run/)
- [Deriving QC data from multiple related mass spectrometry runs](intro_set/)

The following use cases demonstrate how mzQC files can be used for real-life quality control reporting:

- [Tracking instrument performance using controlled QC samples](example_qc2_longitudinal/)
- [Batch correction in metabolomics](example_batch_correction/)

Additionally, for more advanced usage, mzQC can closely interoperate with several other file formats developed by the Proteomics Standards Initiative:

- [Integration of the Universal Spectrum Identifier (USI) in mzQC](adv_mzqc_usi/)
- [Incorporating QC metrics in mzML files](adv_mzqc_in_mzml/)
