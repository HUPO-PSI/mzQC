The following use cases provide several hands-on examples of how mzQC files are structured and can be used:

- [Representing QC data for an individual mass spectrometry run](intro_run/)
- [Deriving QC data from multiple related mass spectrometry runs](intro_set/)
- [QC sample mzQC](QC2-sample-example/)
- [Batch correction](metabo-batches/)

Additionally, for more advanced usage, mzQC can closely interoperate with several other file formats developed by the Proteomics Standards Initiative:

- [Using USI with mzQC](USI-example/)
- [Incorporating QC metrics in mzML files](adv_mzqc_in_mzml/)
