## The HUPO-PSI Quality Control working group

The Human Proteome Organisation (HUPO) Proteomics Standards Initiative (PSI) defines community standards for data representation in biological mass spectrometry to facilitate data comparison, exchange, and verification. The Quality Control (QC) Working Group develops standards and recommendations to describe the quality of mass spectrometry data and related analysis results.

The current projects of the QC working group are:

- mzQC: A standard file format for the exchange, transmission, and archiving of quality metrics derived from biological mass spectrometry.
- QC CV: Integration of controlled vocabulary terms into [PSI-MS CV](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/psi-ms-CV/) to represent quality metrics and related supporting values.
- Reference Implementations: The [MS-Quality-hub](https://github.com/MS-Quality-hub/) GitHub organization hosts implementations for mzQC in Python, R and Java.
