## Metabolomics batch runs example

Here, we describe details of a metabolomics mzQC JSON document used to describe a Studies' quality before and after batch correction methods are applied. 
For description of the general structure of mzQC, see the Single-Run Example of mzQC.
Find the complete file at the bottom of this document or in the example folder.
The mzQC file is made from the acquisions of GC-ToF-MS polar metabolite data of an Arabidopsis nucleotype-plasmotype diallel study as described in [Improved batch correction in untargeted MS-based metabolomics](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007%2Fs11306-016-1015-8). 

```
    "description": "This dataset is based on the analysis of polar extracts from a nucleotype-plasmotype combination study of Arabidopsis for 58 different genotypes. For details of the used plant material we refer to Flood (2015). Analysis of the polar, derivatized metabolites by GC-ToF-MS (Agilent 6890 GC coupled to a Leco Pegasus III MS) and processing of the data were done as described in Villafort Carvalho et al. (2015). Here, the number of metabolites (75) is much lower than in the other two data sets, partly because the focus was on the primary rather than the secondary metabolites. The number of samples was 240, with a percentage of non-detects of 16 %; the maximum fraction of non-detects in individual metabolites is 92 %. All metabolites were retained in the analysis. Four batches of 31-89 samples were employed, containing 2-6 QCs per batch, 14 in total."
```
This example has, as the `description` eludes to, 240 runs, for which each a `qualityMetric` object is present in `qualityMetrics`, for sake of brevity only containing the number of successfully detected metabolites.

For the purpose of batch correction, next described is the set of all runs that are batch corrected. Hence, the `setQualities` field of `inputFiles` contains all regular runs, and the related metric is a principle component analysis of the peak area features of all batches' runs.

The metric describes the results of a PCA in the form of a table. Each contributing run is named in the `Run name` column, at least two dimensions of PC are to be reported in the next columns, and optionally, for better visualisations, `Batch label` and `Injection sequence number` columns provide additional annotations to the included runs.

With a corresponding metric after batch correction methods are applied, a side-by-side comparison of the batch correction results can be easily achieved.
