# Validation
If you have many mzQC files to validate, or the validation API is temporaily unreachable,
you can set up your own validation process without much effort!

The container solution is the least effort, but requires you have the singularity container engine installed.

## Local Installation of pymzqc
This solution requires you to install pymzqc:
```
pip install pymzqc
```
