## Validation
If you have many mzQC files to validate, or the validation API is temporaily unreachable,
you can set up your own validation process without much effort!

### Container
The container solution is the least effort, but requires you have the singularity container engine installed.

### Local Installation of pymzqc
This solution requires you to install pymzqc. 
In most cases it will be as easy as simply `pip install pymzqc`.
For the latest instructions on installation of pymzqc, see [it's repository]().
