# Contribute to mzQC

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! :sparkles:. 

## Contribute Your Metrics

We welcome every metric contribution, be it new or established. The easiest way is to open a new issue on the PSI-MS CV repository with our `New QC Term` template. You can read more detail about the process on the [Metrics page](metrics/).

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README on GitHub](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/blob/main/README.md). 

### Getting started

A good starting point is our website to get informed on the format and it's mechanistics, how to get in touch with us, ongoing issues, and related projects.

### Issues

We use GitHub's issue tracking system to stay on-top of new developments and arising issues. It is generally a good idea to file a new issue before you start making changes to the project (fork).

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose). 

#### Request a new metric

If you miss a specific metric, you can request it's addition via the issue system. It might be good if you'd familiarise yourself with [mzQC](https://hupo-psi.github.io/mzqc/) and [CV metric representation](https://hupo-psi.github.io/mzqc/metrics/) in particular. We have a dedicated issue template for the request of new QC terms in the PSI-MS-CV repository. 

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a working branch and start with your changes!
3. Commit your update(s).

#### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request. 
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

#### Labels

Labels can help you (*and us*) find and organise issues more readily. Here are some labels explained:
- The help wanted label is for problems or updates that anyone in the community can start working on.
- The good first issue label is for problems or updates we think are ideal for beginners.
- The schema label is for problems or updates to the mzQC format itself. These are considered with the outmost care and detail.
- The documentation labels (specification document and website) label issues found in the specification document or with documentation content (such as the website)
- The CV label is for issues and discussion about the metrics and our CV integration.
- obsolete: request for new CV entry (We merged with PSI-MS-CV, see labels there.) 

#### Be nice

Keep our community approachable and respectable, we're all here for the science.
